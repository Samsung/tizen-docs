As part of its efforts to encourage increased participation in the development of the Tizen platform, Samsung will discuss the policies that have been made in collaboration with partners and developers for Voice Touch, Samsung Checkout, Sports/Music services and the security solutions for its 2017 Smart TV lineup.



**Updated Graphics Engine and Wayland Computer Protocol**

The benefit of using the latest Tizen 3.0 Platform is the software, which provides new functionality thanks to an updated graphics engine and Wayland computer protocol.

**Voice Touch**

Voice Touch, one of the new Smart TV 'touch' capabilities, provides owners a more intuitive way to use the voice recognition function. When users speak just into the remote only the title on the TV Apps screen, the icon is activated without navigation or any other process. Samsung Checkout is a pre-installed payment system on Samsung Smart TVs that allows users to conveniently make payments for digital content.



**Making apps with Tizen .NET**

By the end of 2017, Samsung plans to make Tizen .NET a public network for Tizen developers who can now try a preview version of Tizen Smart TV SDK on the site. Since announcing its collaboration with Microsoft on .NET open-source projects such as .NET Core and Xamarin.Forms last November, Samsung has steadily released preview versions of the Tizen .NET SDK to help developers build more powerful apps. This allows them to practice on it and encourage them to participate in its ongoing development.
