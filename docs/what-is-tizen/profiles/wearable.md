# Tizen Wearable

The Tizen platform supports rotary events for user interaction on a wearable rotary device or sensor. The rotary device can rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise, and dispatch an event for each movement. 

The integration with the rotating bezel allow you be free from covering up what's on screen with your fingers. Put simply, it relies on less of your brainpower to quickly access what you need to see and.

On a low-powered wearable device, an ambient mode is available for watch applications. To reduce power consumption, a Tizen watch application displayed on the idle screen in ambient mode can show a limited UI and receives only the ambient tick event every minute.

Many sensors attached on wearable devices to allow users to determine their up-to-the-minute health, fitness, and fitness environmental information:

- Accelerometer, Ambient light sensor, Gyro sensor, Heart rate monitor, Pedometer, GPS, Speedometer, Barometer, and Altimeter.

### Developing Apps for Tizen Wearable

The design aspect of wearables is that it has to be intuitive, augments mobile technology, and less intrusive to the wearer. Watch faces are perfect examples of how a user interfaces with the device without any added learning.
