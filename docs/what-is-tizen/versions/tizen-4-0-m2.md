# Tizen 4.0 M2
Since the first release in 2012, Tizen has evolved adapting to the market requirements and technical advances. As smart devices are widespread in the market, Tizen is deployed to mobile phones, wearable devices, TVs, and home appliances accordingly. In the near future, lots of IoT (Internet of Things) services will pervade everyone's life. Tizen is moving forward as a convergence platform and Tizen 4.0 is another big step to the world of everything connected.

Tizen 4.0 M1 was a significant improvement of development environment: Tizen .NET architecture based on Microsoft's .NET Core and Xamarin.Forms, support of C# application language, and Visual Studio Tools for Tizen. Tizen 4.0 M2 presents more advances in development environment, configuration, and maintenance, which are invigorating the Tizen ecosystem in every respect.

The key features are as follows:
* **Support of .NET Core 2**: Tizen 4.0 M2 utilizes the benefits of [.NET Core 2](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.0/2.0.0.md). .NET Core is widely used for cross-platform development. With the [.NET Standard 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/?view=netstandard-2.0) implemented, the number of APIs is greatly increased. ARM32 Runtime builds for Linux and Windows are available. For information of .NET Core 2 improvements, see [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/08/14/announcing-net-core-2-0/).

* **Wearable Emulator (beta)**: It is convenient to run and check applications on emulators without connecting real target devices. In this version, emulating wearable devices is possible. Deployment of wearables is still at an early stage and the wearable emulator is expected to boost the application ecosystem.

* **Tizen IoT Preview 1**: Tizen 4.0 M2 introduces Tizen IoT, a lightweight embedded Tizen OS for IoT devices. Tizen IoT can be configured for either "Tizen IoT Core (headless mode)" or "Tizen Common (headed mode)." Accordingly, Tizen Studio is configurable for both modes. Initially, Tizen IoT supports two hardware platforms: Artick 530 and Raspberry Pi 3. For more information of Tizen IoT, see [here]().
