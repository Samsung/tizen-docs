# Usability Evaluation Guide

1. Usability Evaluation Definition

   Usability is a necessary condition for survival. If an application is difficult to use, not interesting or not looks good, people will never use it again. In order to offer good quality applications to Tizen Store users, good usability is required as well as other software quality related requirements. Tizen Validation team regard that developer's success is closely related with customer's satisfaction. So, based on international consensus standard, we defined application usability as overall satisfaction on application usage. It covers interest, reliability (performance), easy to use, enough features to achieve goals and application design.

2. Usability Evaluation Criteria
