      The device boots up and the download mode image is displayed on the screen.

1. Connect the device to the Linux PC with a USB cable.

1. Flash the image.

   To flash the image, execute the `lthor` command in a console on the Linux PC:

> Tizen images of version 2.4 and higher do not contain the TM1-hardware-dependent binaries by default. To make TM1 function correctly, you must install the additional binaries manually. For more information, see [Tizen Device Firmware](http://developer.samsung.com/tizendevice/firmware).
