# Tizen 6.0

The second milestone (M2) release of Tizen 6.0 was announced in October 2020.
Tizen is an open-source operating system (OS) maintained by Samsung and is developed and optimized for smart devices since 2012.

The key features of Tizen 6.0 are the enhancement of development environment, core and AI component.

## Enhancement of Development Environment and Core Component

### Tizen.NET

Tizen suppports C# development environment based on .NET Core for application development productivity.
In Tizen 6.0 the latest .NETCore 3.1 and the latest version of cross-platform Xamarin is supported.

There is a advance in the application start-up time and memory usage reduction.
and "XAML Hot Reload" beta service is supported as well.

- **.NET Core** :
Latest .NET Core 3.1(LTS)
Optimized performance
Diagnostics tools

- **TizenFX** :
Tizen platform-specific API set
API level 8 Released

- **Xamarin** :
Latest Xamarin.Forms (4.8.0) & Xamarin.Essentials (1.5.3) are available.
TV UI Controls & CircularUI : New UI controls for Smart TVs and Smart Watches.
XAML Hot Reload : Boosting Developer productivity

### Web framework

Tizen 6.0 provides a new user experience through device-to-device connectivity and interworking.

- Web-based device various offloading services

Tizen 6.0 provides the multi-device offloading service using web technology.

The complexity of applications such as A.I and AR/VR increases in web side, maximization of computational performance within web contents is needed.

### Lightweight Web Solution

Escargot is the Tizen java script engine for the product having Hardware resource restriction.
Compared to Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, it makes about 14% reduction in binary size and about 35% reduction in memory usage based on the benchmark application.
It supports ES6 full specficiation and supports up to a large part of ES 10.

- **Lightweight JavaScript engine (ESCARGOT)** in https://github.com/Samsung/excargot

  - Memory size  (vs chrome v8) octane benchmark in Ubuntu 18.04
    - Binary size : 13.7 %
    - Average RSS : 35.1 %

  - Features
    - Support ES6 Full feature and partial support of ES10

## AI Integrated Intelligent Platform

NNSteamer is an on-device AI framework that makes it easy to configure complex artificial neural networks in application by making artificial neural network configurations with Gstreamer's plugin.

In this 6.0, NN Runtime support such as control-flow and dynamic tensor has been added to support voice model acceleration. In addition, by providing the NN Compiler front-end for NN Runtime, it can convert well-known models such as Tensorflow and tensorflow-lite so that they can be used on CE devices with insufficient resources (on NNRuntime).

- NNStreamer
  - Neural Network Pipeline
    - .NET and C APIs supported.
    - Various NPU hardware supported.
    - Basic EDGE-AI functions.
  - Implement AI app more easily
  - Execute AI app more efficiently

- NNTrainer
  - On-Device Training
    - Transfer learning, meta learning, reinforcement learning
    - APIs to construct and update (learn!) neural network layers

- NN Runtime
  - Tizenâ€™s default Neural Network inference framework (since v5.0)
  - CPU+GPU mixed acceleration with profiling based optimal scheduling (since v5.5)
  - Useful features for speech model support (in v6.0)
    - Control-flow, Dynamic Tensor, Shape Inference, etc.

- NN Compiler in Tizen SDK
  - Support well known ML frameworks, and model formats
    - Tensorflow, Tensorflow-lite (preferential), Caffe, ONNX (experimental)
  - Easy scalability through Common IR and NN Package

### Core and Kernel
 - TIDL Extension, Multi-package installation supported in Application framework
 - Gesture FW and engine supported in Window and Interaction frameworks
 - DALi (3D UI Toolkit) API set of DALi has been deprecated. DALi API set has been replaced with NUI (DALi C# layer) in Graphics frameworks
 - Ultra wideband (UWB) ranging, Wi-Fi multiple interface supported in Network and Connectivity framework.
 - Kernel for Raspberry Pi 4 has been upgraded to version 5.4.50.
 - 64Bit kernel and boot for Raspberry-Pi 4 has been supported.
 - etc.
