# Tizen Wearable

Tizen Wearable profile makes it easy to develop applications for wearable rotary devices or sensors that support rotary events for user interaction. A rotary device can rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise, and dispatch an event for each movement.

The integration with the rotating bezel avoids the disadvantage of covering up the screen with your fingers. Put simply, it relies less on the user's brainpower and memory, allowing them to easily see the screen while performing necessary actions.

On a low-powered wearable device, an ambient mode is available for watch applications. To reduce power consumption, a Tizen watch application displayed on the idle screen in ambient mode can show a limited UI and receives the ambient tick event only once a minute.

Various sensors attached to wearable devices allow the user to determine their up-to-the-minute health, fitness, and fitness environmental information:

- Accelerometer
- Ambient light sensor
- Gyro sensor
- Heart rate monitor
- Pedometer
- GPS
- Speedometer
- Barometer
- Altimeter

### Developing Applications for Tizen Wearable

The design aspect of wearable applications is that they must augment mobile technology, and be intuitive and less intrusive to the device wearer. Watch faces are perfect examples of how to create a user interface that requires no added learning from the user.

To develop applications for the wearable profile:

- [Create Wearable .NET Applications](../../../application/dotnet/get-started/wearable/first-app.md)
- [Create Wearable Web Applications](../../../application/web/get-started/wearable/first-app.md)
- [Create Wearable Native Applications](../../../application/native/get-started/wearable/first-app.md)

## Design Guidelines for Tizen Wearable

You can see the Wearable design guidelines on [SAMSUNG Developers site](https://developer.samsung.com/galaxy-watch/design/principle){:target="_blank"}.

## Tizen Wearable Devices

From the Samsung Gear 2 Neo to the current Gear S3, all wearable devices have their own characteristics that boast their functionalities. Each also has their own design language that harnesses their functionality.
