# Tizen TV

Tizen TV allows you to develop applications for Samsung Smart TVs.

Tizen Open Source Project introduced an expanded Tizen platform for Smart TVs at the fifth annual [Tizen Developer Conference](https://www.tizen.org/events/2017/tizen-developer-conference-2017) (TDC)  in San Francisco at the Hilton Union Square.

The TV provides various exciting features as follows:

- **Ready to connect! Get involved!**  
Samsung encourages you to participate in the development of the Tizen platform. Various policies have already been made in collaboration with partners and developers, especially for Voice Touch, Samsung Checkout, Sports/Music services, and the security solutions for the 2017 Smart TV models.  
  Samsung Checkout is a pre-installed payment system on Samsung Smart TVs that allows the user to conveniently make payments for digital content.
- **Updated graphics engine and Wayland computer protocol**  
The benefit of using the latest Tizen 3.0 platform is the software, which provides new functionality thanks to an updated graphics engine and Wayland computer protocol. These deliver enhanced graphics, improved stability, and an improved user interface, creating a more desirable Smart TV user experience.
- **Voice Touch**  
Voice Touch, one of the new Smart TV "touch" capabilities, provides the user with a more intuitive way to use the voice recognition function. When the user wants to run an app on the TV, they can say the title out loud on their remote control. The icon is then activated and the application launches without navigation or other actions.
- **Making applications with Tizen .NET**  
Tizen .NET enables TV application development using C# and the .NET ecosystem, providing:
  - Access to TV-specific APIs through TizenFX
  - High-performance application development
  - Cross-platform capabilities with .NET Standard
  - Robust memory management and security features
Developers can leverage these capabilities to build efficient TV applications that integrate with Smart TV features like Voice Touch and Samsung Checkout.
