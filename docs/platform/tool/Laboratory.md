**Automated Testing Laboratory** is an autonomous device to help with
developing, testing and releasing images of operating system. It was
primarily designed for Tizen, but turned out to be so generic that can
be used with any operating system.

The basic idea behind the device is to do automated testing on many
boards at once. In order to achieve that, there is a setup of different
boards, which can be flashed with images to be tested. Next, the
compliance tests are run on each individual board and the results are
published. All the steps, from downloading and flashing images to
uploading and running tests and finally publishing results, are fully
automated and can be run without any attention from operator.

Testing laboratory consists of 6 boards with different architectures
([x86](x86 "wikilink"), [x86\_64](x86_64 "wikilink"),
[ARM](ARM "wikilink"), [ARM64](ARM64 "wikilink")) and 6
[SD-MUX](SD_MUX "wikilink") units.
