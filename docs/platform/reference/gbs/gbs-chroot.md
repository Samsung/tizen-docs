# gbs chroot

Use the `chroot` subcommand to chroot to the build root directory, which is generated by the GBS build.

For command usage details, enter:

```
$ gbs chroot --help
```

> **Note**
>
>  The default location of the build root is located in `~/GBS-ROOT/local/scratch.{arch}.*`. The location is different if the `-B` option is specified while running the GBS build.

Examples:

- Create a build root with extra packages added to the build root:

  ```
  $ gbs build --extra-packs=zypper,vim -A i586 # install zypper,vim to build root
  ```

  For more GBS build options, see [gbs build](gbs-build.md).

- Chroot to the build root:

  ```
  $ gbs chroot ~/GBS-ROOT/local/scratch.i686.0/
  ```

- Chroot as a "root" user:

  ```
  $ gbs chroot -r ~/GBS-ROOT/local/scratch.i686.0/
  ```

  If the command fails with a "su: user root does not exist" error, it is caused by a Tizen repository. Fix the problem by adding a root user manually by editing the following 2 files:

  ```
  $ echo "root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >>path/to/buildroot/etc/passwd
  $ echo "root:x:0:" >>path/to/buildroot/etc/group
  ```

- Chroot and install extra packages into the build root directory for development purposes:

  ```
  chroot as 'root':
  $ gbs chroot -r ~/GBS-ROOT/local/scratch.i686.0/
  Configure tizen repo in the chroot env:
  # zypper ar http://download.tizen.org/releases/daily/<release_id>/repos/main/ia32/packages tizen-main
  # zypper ar http://download.tizen.org/releases/daily/<release_id>/repos/base/ia32/packages tizen-base
  Install extra packages, for example, install gdb.
  # zypper refresh
  # zypper -n install gdb gcc
  ```

  For https repositories, you must specify the `ssl_verify=no` option:

  ```
  # zypper ar https://user:passwd@tizen.org/releases/daily/<release_id>/repos/main/ia32/packages/?ssl_verify=no tizen-main
  ```

> **Note**
>
> - To use the `gbs chroot` command as "root", specify the `-r` option. Then zypper can be used to install and remove packages.
> - To install packages in the build root environment, specify the `-n` option:
>   ```
>   zypper -n install gdb
>   ```
