# gbs export

Use the `gbs export` subcommand to export a Git tree to a tarball and spec file.

For command usage details, enter:

```
$ gbs export --help
```

Examples:

- Export source code to a default packaging directory:

  ```
  $ gbs export
  info: Generating patches from git (upstream/4.1.5..HEAD)
  info: Didn't find any old 'Patch' tags, adding new patches after the last 'Source' tag.
  info: Didn't find any old '%patch' macros, adding new patches after the last '%setup' macro
  pristine-tar: successfully generated /var/tmp/.gbs_export_UJn0nS/sed-4.1.5.tar.gz
  info: package files have been exported to:
  /home/test/sed/packaging/sed-4.1.5-1
  $ diff packaging/sed.spec packaging/sed-4.1.5-1/sed.spec
  11a12,13
  > # Patches auto-generated by git-buildpackage:
  > Patch0: 0001-hello.patch
  > 25a28,29
  > # 0001-hello.patch
  > %patch0 -p1
  ```

  From the log, you can see that a patch has been generated, and a tarball is created from the pristine-tar branch. The `--no-patch-export` option can be used to disable this feature and generate a tarball from the current branch directly.

- Use the `-o` option to generate packaging files to a specified path:

  ```
  $ gbs export -o ~/
  ```

- Use the `--source-rpm` option to generate a source RPM package:

  ```
  $ gbs export -o ~/ --source-rpm
  ```

- Use the `--spec` option, if there are multiple spec files:

  ```
  $ gbs export --spec=dlog.spec
  ```

  The `--spec` option only accepts a file name and must not contain any path info. GBS prefixes the packaging directory automatically.

- Use the `--fallback-to-native` option to force the export process to perform packaging for non-native packages in the native packaging mode, ignoring the upstream branch and creating a tarball from HEAD (by default) or specified commit without generating any patch. Adding the `--fallback-to-native` option when issuing the `gbs export` command is equivalent to adding the `fallback_to_native = true` property to the `[general]` section of the GBS configuration file.

  > **Note**
  >
  > This option serves as a work-around solution for solving export failures of some non-native packages caused by a tricky engineering problem. For Tizen native packages, the `gbs export` command always performs packaging in the native packaging mode.

  ```
  $ gbs export --fallback-to-native
  ```
