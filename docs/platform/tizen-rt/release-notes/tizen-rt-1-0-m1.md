    - Stackmonitor
    - Heap analyzer
      - Allocated heap size (total and per thread)
      - Address calling mm API
    - Ramdump / Coredump
  - Logger Module
  - System logging (Syslog)
  - Shell tools: date, dmesg, getenv, free, heapinfo, kill/killall, ps, setenv, stkmon, unsetenv
- Device Driver
  - GPIO, I2C, UART, PWM and Pipe
    - Controlled by file operation
    - SPI
    - USB CDC/ACM
- File System
  - Bad Sector Management
    - File System checks for bad sectors during write operations and maintains a list of bad sectors in the physical flash memory.
  - Dynamic Header
    - This technique reuses a sector of smartfs throughout all write operations into that sector without relocation (smartfs reallocates sectors when a file is rewritten).
  - Sector Recovery
    - Tool to recover lost sectors after power failure (smartfs only) has been added.
  - Journaling
    - Transaction-Logging based Journaling feature has been added.
    - This feature requires several sectors, based on the number of file descriptors.
- AraStorage
  - Query Interface
    - SQL-like query interface exposed: Simple and Standard relations
    - Wrapper for AQL command input to the relational query parser
    - Readable, interactive, expandable form constructs for specifying search constraints and AQL object attributes
  - Index Algorithm
    - Optimizes the execution of database queries by delimiting the set of tuples that must be processed:
      - Inline: Useful for Ordered Data sets
      - B+ based Index: Useful for MASS Data sets
  - Storage Abstraction
    - Use a basic POSIX APIs in VFS to support Database operations.
  - Cursor
    - Added a cursor structure to allow easier use of AraStorage.
- Network and Connectivity
  - LWIP
    - LWIP 1.4.1 release code is taken as the base network stack for TinyAra.
    - Support for IPv4, TCP, UDP, ICMP, ARP, IGMP , DHCPc & Generic sockets is provided.
    - Missing POSIX API support for all the network APIs is enabled in TinyAra. TinyAra OS compatibility and performance improvements.
    - Fixes in the LWIP stack to give desired result on applications, such as DHCP, DNS, HTTP, IoTivity, TELNET, and WEBSOCKETS.
    - Samples for TCP/UDP for unicast/multicast testing and stress testing are provided.
    - LWIP stack is verified over performance tool iperf to measure the reliability and throughput of the stack.
    - Added ARP retransmission and updated the ARP timer.
    - Socket structures belong to the task (not to global variables). When the task is terminated, the socket is also destroyed. Dup can be also applied for sharing among multiple threads.
  - IoTivity
    - IoTivity 1.1.0 release code is taken as base code for TinyAra.
    - Secured resources for device to device (through the UDP adapter) are supported.
    - Provisioning, ownership transfer, and access control features are enabled for the d2d scenario.
    - Registering to the IoTivity 1.1.0 cloud and getting the auth provider is supported.
    - Publishing the IoTivity resources over the IoTivity 1.1.0 cloud is supported.
    - CoAP over TCP is supported for communication to the IoTivity 1.1.0 cloud infrastructure.
    - Sample support for IoTivity_nosecurity, Security, Cloud, and IoTivity over UDP is provided.
- Shell (TASH)
  - Supports 2 command types:
    - Synchronization
      - Execute a command immediately in the shell context.
    - Asynchronization
      - Execute a command in a new pthread context.
  - Support API to register commands by each module has been enabled.
  - Executing a shell script is supported.
- Framework
  - System I/O (5 API sets)
    - GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)
    - I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
    - SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
    - PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation)
    - UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)
  - Device Management (2 API sets)
    - LWM2M Client
    - Connectivity Monitoring
  - AraStorage (1 API set)

## Known Issues

- Pthread Cancellation
  - When the `pthread_cancel()` function is called to terminate a pthread, resource used for the pthread is not freed.
- FOTA Support
  - Device driver and HAL APIs are provided, but chip dependency code must be updated. After updates, the APIs will be fixed.
- Wi-Fi Support
  - Network stack is provided, but there is no Wi-Fi stack.  Wi-Fi stack is provided soon. After the Wi-Fi stack is added, the network functionality will work correctly.
