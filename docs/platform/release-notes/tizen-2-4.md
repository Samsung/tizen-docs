## SDK Release Notes

### Tizen 2.4 Rev8  (Aug. 2, 2016)

#### **IDE and Tools**

**New Features**

- CLI/SDB
  - When you specify commands to be executed during the pre-build or post-build steps in the build_def.prop file, you can use the PROJ_PATH, BUILD_CONFIG, and BUILD_ARCH environment variables in the commands.

**Changed Features**

- Native UI Builder
  - When you build the UI of a wearable application, you cannot use the Panel UI component. The component is not supported in wearable applications.
  - Support for new API set for the wearable widget have been added. Old API set in the project code of the wearable widget, which were shared with the wearable application, have been replaced with the new API set.

**Fixed Bugs**

- Web IDE
  -  The first execution of the **Build Package** command for Web application projects sometimes failed due to a JavaScript validation problem. This bug has been fixed.
- Native IDE
  - When you tried to debug an application running on a connected target device through the **Debug As > Tizen Native Application – Attach** menu, you could not attach the debugger to the application in the **Debug Configurations** dialog. This bug has been fixed.
  - When you exported a package with multiple projects to a CLI project, and one of the projects was a Static and Shared Library project, the information of the referenced library project was not set in the def.prop file of the reference project. This bug has been fixed.
- Native UI Builder
  - The Tizen Store did not accept a wearable circle application developed by the native UI Builder, because some blacklist API set were used in the Builder. This bug has been fixed.
  - When an event handler was added to a view layout, if the view layout contained an event-handler-added UI component, an error occurred. This bug has been fixed.
- Emulator
  - Due to an internal problem, the ECP CLI did not provide the correct acceleration values of the 3-axis sensors. This bug has been fixed.

**Known Issues**

- Installer and Update Manager
  - If the SDK Update Notification appears when you start the Tizen IDE or Emulator on Mac OS X, a terminal (shell.exec) icon can appear on the dock for a few seconds.

**Known Issues**

- Installer and Update Manager
  - Some errors in the update command of the 2.4 rev1 and rev2 CLI Installer have been found. If you use the 2.4 rev1 or rev2 CLI Installer, you fail to update your Tizen SDK. To solve the problem, CLI installer patch files are released. Download the patch at the *download location* and do the following: Open the terminal or command line, and go to the location where the downloaded patch file exists. Move the patch file to the location where the SDK is installed. At the prompt, type **update-manager-cli_2.4_patch update_{OS}_{bit}.{bin|exe}** to install the patch.
  - You can also upgrade your CLI Installer to the 2.4 rev3 at the [Tizen SDK Download page](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-studio/download). If there is a multibyte character in the Tizen SDK installation path, some development packages have a difficulty in finding the installed SDK’s location when they are working. When you run the dynamic analyzer on Mac OS X, the SDK Update Notification does not appear even though there are available SDK updates. If the SDK Update Notification appears when you start the Tizen IDE or Emulator on Mac OS X, a terminal (shell.exec) icon can appear on the dock for a few seconds.


- Native IDE
  - When you import some projects generated from Tizen 2.3 Rev2, the importing can take some time.
  - The **Restore Defaults** feature in the native project’s **Properties > C/C++ Build** does not work properly.


- Native UI Builder
  - When the WYSIWYG editor of the Native UI Builder for Windows is running, project deletion does not work properly. To deal with this problem, close the editor.
  - If the WYSIWYG editor of the Native UI Builder for Windows runs for more than 12 hours, your computer slows down because of the editor's high memory usage. To free  from this situation, restart the Tizen IDE.


- Emulator
  - Ubuntu sometimes stops responding for a few seconds after closing the Emulator Manager. This issue is related to an Intelligent Input Bus (IBus) bug. When the issue occurs, restart the ibus-daemon by entering the **ibus-daemon –drx** command at the command prompt, and use another framework, such as uim and fcitx, for multilingual input.
  - To use the Tizen Emulator, install an Intel VTx supported by the CPU, and the latest version of the graphic card driver provided by the vendor. Check the prerequisites for the Tizen Emulator. If the host machine is using Nvidia Optimus™ technology on either Ubuntu or Windows, you must set the Tizen Emulator to run with your Nvidia graphics card. In case of Ubuntu, check the bumblebee project ([https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee)). In case of Windows, select "High Speed NVIDIA Processor" as "Preferred Graphics processor" in the Nvidia control panel. On Ubuntu, if the graphics driver is out-of-date, your Ubuntu desktop session can be occasionally logged out when launching the Emulator Manager, or the Emulator skin can be drawn improperly. Check the prerequisites and upgrade to the latest graphics driver.
  - On Ubuntu 14.04, a shortcut menu can sometimes appear transparent.
  - On Windows, depending on your OS theme (such as Non-Aero themes and Windows XP themes), a display surface can be erased for a while if the Emulator window is covered with another window. If you click the Emulator window, the display surface runs correctly again.
  - On Windows, if a ‘failed to allocate memory’ error occurred while executing the Emulator, try the following:
    - Close some other programs and try to launch the Emulator again.
    - If the RAM size is set to 768 or 1024 MB for the VM in the Emulator Manager, change it to 512 MB.
    - Increase the user area of the virtual memory in the system to 3 GB by entering the **bcdedit /set increaseuserva 3072** command on the console with administrator rights (Windows 7 only), and reboot.
  - If you use a MacBook Pro which has both Intel HD and NVidia GPUs, when you execute the Emulator with the **OpenGL ES ver. v1.1 & v2.0** option, the Emulator can be unexpectedly terminated. Use the **OpenGL ES ver. v2.0 & v3.0** option.


- SDB
  - To use the SDB bash completion feature, enter the source **.sdb-complete.bash** command on the bash shell. The feature runs manually from Tizen 2.4 official due to the Installer and Update Manager issue.

**Known Issues**

- Installer and Update Manager
  -  The update command of the 2.4 rev1 and rev2 CLI installer has some errors. If you use the 2.4 rev1 or rev2 CLI installer, the Tizen SDK update fails.  To solve the problem, download [CLI installer patch files](http://download.tizen.org/sdk/old/patches/), and do the following (or upgrade your CLI installer to the 2.4 rev3 at the [Tizen SDK Download page](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-studio/download)):
    - Open the terminal or command line, and go to the location where you have downloaded the patch file.
    - Move the patch file to the location where the SDK is installed.
    - At the prompt, enter the update-manager-cli_2.4_patch update_{OS}_{bit}.{bin|exe} command to install the patch.
  -  If there is a multibyte character in the Tizen SDK installation path, some development packages have a difficulty in finding the installed SDK’s location when they are working.
  -  When you run the dynamic analyzer on Mac OS X, the SDK Update Notification does not appear though there are available SDK updates.
  -  If the SDK Update Notification appears when you start the Tizen IDE or Emulator on Mac OS X, a terminal (shell.exec) icon can appear on the dock for a few seconds.


- Native IDE
  - When you import some projects generated from Tizen 2.3 Rev2, the importing can take some time.
  - The **Restore Defaults** feature in the **native project’s properties > C/C++ Build** does not work properly.
- Native UI Builder
  - When the WYSIWYG editor of the native UI Builder for Windows is running, project deletion does not work properly. To deal with this problem, close the editor.
  - If the WYSIWYG editor of the native UI Builder for Windows runs over 12 hours, your computer slows down because of the editor's high memory usage. To deal with this problem, restart the Tizen IDE.


- Emulator
  - Ubuntu sometimes stops responding for a few seconds after closing the Emulator Manager. This issue is related to a bug of Intelligent Input Bus (IBus). When the issue occurs, restart the ibus-daemon by entering the ibus-daemon –drx command at the command prompt, and use another framework, such as uim and fcitx, for multilingual input.
  - To use the Tizen Emulator, install an Intel VTx supported by the CPU, and the latest version of the graphic card driver which the vendor provides.
    - If the host machine is using Nvidia Optimus™ technology on either Ubuntu or Windows, you must set the Tizen Emulator to run with your Nvidia graphics card. In case of Ubuntu, check the bumblebee project ([https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee)). In case of Windows, select "High Speed NVIDIA Processor" as "Preferred Graphics processor" in the Nvidia control panel.
    - On Ubuntu, if the graphics driver is out-of-date, your Ubuntu desktop session can be occasionally logged out when launching the Emulator Manager, or the Emulator skin can be drawn improperly. Check the prerequisites and upgrade to the latest graphics driver.
  - On Ubuntu 14.04, a shortcut menu can appear transparently sometimes.
  - On Windows, depending on your OS theme (such as Non-Aero themes and Windows XP themes), a display surface can be erased for a while if the Emulator window is covered with another window. If you click the Emulator window, the display surface runs correctly again.
  - On Windows, if a ‘failed to allocate memory’ error occurred while executing the Emulator, try the following:
    - Close some other programs and try to launch the Emulator again.
    - If the RAM size is set to 768 or 1024 MB for the VM in the Emulator Manager, change it to 512 MB.
    - Increase the user area of the virtual memory in the system to 3 GB by entering the bcdedit /set increaseuserva 3072 command on the console with administrator rights (Windows 7 only). And reboot.
  - If you use a MacBook Pro which has both Intel HD and NVidia GPUs, when you execute the Emulator with the **OpenGL ES ver. v1.1 & v2.0** option, the Emulator can be unexpectedly terminated. Use the **OpenGL ES ver. v2.0 & v3.0** option.
- SDB
  - To use the SDB bash completion feature, enter the source .sdb-complete.bash command on the bash shell. The feature runs manually from Tizen 2.4 official due to the Installer and Update Manager issue.
