##### Native Framework

The Tizen platform provides a new API for native applications in Tizen 2.3, replacing the previous Tizen 2.2.1 Native API. The primary development language for native applications has changed from C++ to C. However, the C++ standard library has been provided as an open source library, so C++ can still be used to create the application logic that does not use any Tizen platform features. This big change has been made for the following reasons:

- The Tizen native framework currently only supports the mobile profile. However, in the near future, multiple other device profiles, such as wearable and TV will be supported. A new Native API is required to ensure that the native framework is lightweight and fast to run well on both low- and high-end profiles and devices.
- With the new native framework, minimal porting effort is required to run native applications on multiple Tizen device profiles.
- Improved scalability, and fast, themeable, and easily customizable graphics are now possible by using the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL).
- More than 10 open source libraries are now available to 3rd party applications through the native framework. This is particularly advantageous for developers who are already familiar with some of these libraries, because they can quickly add features and use previous written code in certain cases.

Note that you cannot use the new Tizen 2.3 SDK to develop native applications that have been written with the older Tizen SDKs. If you want to develop a native application written with an older Tizen SDK, rewrite your application with the new Tizen 2.3 SDK. The signature changes of Native APIs from Tizen 2.3 Beta to Tizen 2.3 release can be found from [here](http://download.tizen.org/misc/change-log/Native%20API%20Changes.pdf).

  - The Connection Explorer view sometime does not show all running Emulator information.
- Web UI Builder
  - The text functions (ellipsis and line-break) are sometimes displayed differently with an actual operation.
  - Some TAU widgets are not included in the widget palette nor work properly.
  - The selected resolution in the N-Screen View is not applied on the application.
  - In some cases, the designer does not work properly if you modify the HTML code directly.
  - The scroll bar is displayed in the middle of the content area in the Simulator, if the animation applies to the content.
  - The animation does not work properly with N-Screen.
  - The IDE creates a console window when an internal browser has been created in Windows 8.
- Emulator
  - On Windows, depending on your OS theme (such as non-Aero themes and Windows XP themes), a display surface can be erased for a while if the Emulator window is obscured by another window. If you click the Emulator window, the display surface works correctly again.
  - The Emulator skin cannot be drawn properly on Ubuntu, if the graphics driver is not installed or an old version is installed. To fix this issue, upgrade the graphics driver.
  - When the disk storage is full, various incorrect operations can occur.
  - To use the Tizen Emulator, you need, for example, an Intel VTx supported by the CPU, and the latest vendor-provided version of the graphic card driver. 
    - On Ubuntu, if the host machine is using Nvidia Optimus technology, you can set the Tizen Emulator to run with your Nvidia graphics card through the bumblebee project: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee)
  - The browser for the map of the location tab does not support HTTPS/SSL certificate on Ubuntu.
  - Sound control does not work properly in wearable settings application.
