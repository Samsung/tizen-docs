### Machine learning

## New and changed features

### Machine Learning (ML) API updates
  - ML.Service API Updates
    - Add new API to provide machine learning service with a configuration file. Application users can easily use the machine learning service by writing necessary options in the configuration file. The API is designed to be simple and flexible, allowing developers to create, manage, and use machine learning service in their applications. A key feature of this API is that it allows users to manage these capabilities using the configuration file, simplifying the process of setting up and managing machine learning service without updating the application. This API can be used not only within on-device but also on the remote (edge) device using the same API.
    - By modifying the configuration file, the application developer can construct various AI services, such as 1) request inference to single model on the device or remote device 2) request inference for more complex tasks such as requiring many models or GStreamer's performant data processing functionalities on the device or remote device 3) model and AI pipeline registration to the remote device.
  - ML.Inference API Updates
    - Add API for cloning tensor data and managing tensor information.

### NNStreamer updates
  - NNStreamer has been upgraded to version 2.4.1.
  - Add mlops-agent daemon to support on-device MLOps and model-agnostic applications.
    - Based on the configuration file, the application can support various ML frameworks, H/W Accelerators, and Input/Output formats without rebuilding the application.
    - ML Application can update the model package, store the data for On-Device training, and manage the model version.

### Open source updates
  - TensorFlow-Lite2 has been upgraded to version 2.15.0.
  - Flatbuffers has been upgraded to version v23.5.26.
