## Release Notes

Tizen is an open source, standards-based software platform supported by leading mobile operators, device manufacturers, and chip suppliers for multiple device categories, including smartphones, tablets, netbooks, in-vehicle infotainment devices, and smart TVs.

The Tizen Platform consists of the web framework (APIs), native framework (APIs), and core system.

The Tizen Software Development Kit (SDK) is a comprehensive set of tools for developing Web applications, native applications, and the platform component for Tizen. The SDK contains an install manager, IDE, tools, documents, samples, and a platform image.

### Known Issues

- Web IDE

  - In the Web-signing CLI, the password input problem still exists. To work around this, insert passwords in the profile.xml file before signing.
  - The advanced Declaration view for JavaScript has several known issues due to JSDT-related bugs.
  - Assignment tracing for JavaScript has several known issues:
    - If local variables are used as a method name in a method call expression, assignment tracing does not function.
    - Incorrect activation occurs if the inner and outer methods are both anonymous.
  - The template namespaces have been changed to *www.tizen.org*. If you cannot see the project templates or samples in the Project Wizard, modify the namespaces in the tizen-app-template.xml file of the template directory accordingly.

- Native IDE

  - Debugging
    - Attach debugging does not work because the executable is built with the -fPIE option.
  - RDS (Rapid Development Support)
    - RDS is not supported in multi-process application projects.
    - RDS is not supported in CLI tools.
    - RDS does not support signing.
  - CLI (Command Line Interface)
    - The project path and Tizen SDK path are fixed when the project is generated. If you change the path, the project cannot be built.
    - .bat files are not provided for Windows.
  - Unit test
    - The Test Explorer does not work if the project files have not been changed. In this case, edit the code manually, build the project, and run it.
  - Code coverage
    - Code coverage is not supported for the LLVM toolchain. To use code coverage, use the GCC toolchain.
  - Valgrind
    - Valgrind profiling is only supported in the Emulator.

- Emulator

  - OpenGL ES acceleration can have problems in certain environments:

    - Windows XP/7 with Intel motherboard integrated card
    - Ubuntu 11.10 with Intel CPU/motherboard integrated card

    If this occurs, turn off the HW GL acceleration in the Emulator Manager. The HW GL acceleration can be disabled due to host capability, even though you select 'HW GL Acceleration supported' in the Emulator Manager.

  - When you launch the Emulator on Windows, you can get a "failed to allocate memory" error. In that case, try the following:

    - Increase the user area of the virtual memory in the system to 3 GB by running the "bcdedit /set increaseuserva 3072" command on the console with administrator rights (Windows 7 only).
    - Close some other programs and try to launch the Emulator again.
    - If you have set the RAM size as 768 or 1024 MB for the VM in the Emulator Manager, change the RAM size to 512 MB.

  - Using the Emulator with SOCKS (SOCKet Secure) proxy on Mac OS X can cause unexpected problems.

  - You cannot play some video files linked in YouTube, or other Web pages, using the browser on the Emulator.

  - The Emulator log file (emulator.log) can become too large if you run the Emulator for a long time.

  - The Emulator screenshot is drawn with a framebuffer of a virtual device. Sometimes the screenshot may not appear correctly.

  - When you use the camera on Mac OS X, the brightness and contrast settings would not work.

  - Some menu items of the top menu bars of the Emulator and the Emulator Manager do not work on Mac OS X.

- Dynamic analyzer

  - A screenshot is sometimes not taken if the screen or scene change is implemented using an animation technique.

- Install Manager

  - A shortcut is not provided in Mac OS X.
  - If a dialog displays that the Install Manager is damaged on Mac OS, please see [http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5290](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5290).

- # Next Release

- The next version, Tizen 2.1, will be released in the 2nd quarter of 2013. As a minor release, it will only contain several new features and performance enhancement without API modifications or removal. The main features of Tizen 2.1 include account management, application installing service, livebox support, performance optimization, and a security enhancement.
