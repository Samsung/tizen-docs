#### Known Issues

- Common IDE

  - RDS (Rapid Development Support)
    - RDS is not supported in multi-process application projects
    - RDS is not supported in CLI tools
  - CLI (Command Line Interface)
    - The project path and Tizen SDK path are fixed when the project is generated. If you change the path, the project cannot be built.

- Web IDE

  - The advanced Declaration view for JavaScript has several known issues due to JSDT-related bugs
  - The Lock function of the advanced Declaration view has been disabled because of a NullPointerException issue
  - Assignment tracing for JavaScript has several known issues:
    - If local variables are used as a method name in a method call expression, assignment tracing does not function
    - Incorrect activation occurs if the inner and outer methods are both anonymous
  - Web Simulator
    - Only a single application can run at a time
    - Modules not supported: DataControl, MessagePort, SecureElement, Bookmark, and DataSynchronization
    - Daylight saving time-related methods are not supported in the Time module
  - The "could not delete resources" problem while building is fixed
  - An error can occur in the Web UI Builder template when you try to perform the clean and build action. This is a bug in the JavaScript Validator in Eclipse, and can be resolved as follows:
    1. Uncheck JavaScript Validator in the Builders section of the application properties.
    2. Delete errors in the Problems view.
    3. Clean and build the project again.

- Native IDE

  - Unit test
    - Currently, the unit test is designed to support only functional testing
    - Unit Test application is not an OSP-based application. Therefore, some methods related with OSP application framework, such as methods of the Tizen::Base::String class, can behave incorrectly.
    - The Test Explorer does not work if the project files have not been changed. In this case, edit the code manually, build the project, and run it.
  - Valgrind
    - Valgrind profiling is only supported in the Emulator

- Emulator

  - If you run the Emulator with Oracle Java 1.7 or higher on Mac OS, it may result in your host machine getting slower. If you run two or more Emulator VMs, Occasionally booting the Emulator does no work.

  - Your Ubuntu desktop session can be occasionally logged out when launching the Emulator Manager, if you use NVIDIA graphic card. In that case, install the latest driver directly from the NVIDIA website.

  - OpenGL ES acceleration can have problems in certain environments:

    - Windows XP/7 with Intel motherboard integrated card
    - Ubuntu 11.10 with Intel CPU/motherboard integrated card

    If this occurs, you can launch the Emulator by switching off the HW GL acceleration in the Emulator Manager. However, you cannot use any GL-related applications, such as a Web browser.

  - When you launch the Emulator on Windows, you can get a "failed to allocate memory" error. In that case, try the following:

    - Increase the user area of the virtual memory in the system to 3 GB by running the "bcdedit /set increaseuserva 3072" command on the console with administrator rights (Windows 7 only)
    - Close some other programs and try to launch the Emulator again
    - If you have set the RAM size as 768 or 1024 MB for the VM in the Emulator Manager, change the RAM size to 512 MB

  - Using the Emulator with SOCKS (SOCKet Secure) proxy on Mac OS X can cause unexpected problems

  - You cannot play all video files that are linked in YouTube or other Web pages and require the browsers registered to them

  - The Emulator log file (emulator.log) can become too large if you run the Emulator for a long time

- Dynamic analyzer

  - A screenshot is sometimes not taken if the screen or scene change is implemented using an animation technique
  - The analysis of the IME and Service Applications is not supported

- Install Manager

  - A shortcut is not provided in Mac OS X
