# Tizen Common milestones

Tizen Common is the common subset of the Tizen profiles, used by platform developers to develop the next version of the profiles. As such, it does not have releases in the traditional fashion. Instead, it has quarterly milestones.

If you encounter problems with the Tizen Common milestones, you're encouraged to interact directly with the Tizen platform developers by subscribing to the [tizen dev mailing list](https://lists.tizen.org/listinfo/dev).
