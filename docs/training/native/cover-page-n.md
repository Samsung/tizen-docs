# Introduction to Native Applications

The introduction to native applications documentation provides overall
information you need to become familiar with native-specific Tizen
programming and the Tizen application model:

-   [Getting Started](getting-started-n.md)

    Demonstrates how you can create your first simple
    native application.

- [Application Development Process](process/app-dev-process-n.md)

    Teaches you how to create a Tizen application from the initial
    application planning stage to the end stages where you are ready to
    run and package your application.

- [Tizen Application Model](app-model/application-model-n.md)

    Provides an introduction to the Tizen application life-cycle and
    package contents.

- [Overview of Tizen UI
    Development](feature/ui-builder-overview-mn.md)

    Describes the basic characteristics and components of UI development
    with EFL.

- [Designing Your Native
    Application](feature/ui-builder-app-design-mn.md)

    Teaches you how to develop a native application using the native UI
    Builder tool.

- [Understanding Tizen Programming](details/details-n.md)

    Introduces the Tizen platform, its architecture, and some useful
    programming concepts you need to take into account when designing
    Tizen applications.

- [Creating Applications with Connectivity and
    Network](feature/app-connectivity-n.md)

    Demonstrates how you can create applications with connectivity to
    access various networks to use data services, or connect to
    other devices.

- [Creating Applications with Contacts](feature/app-contacts-n.md)

    Demonstrates how you can create applications that handle various
    people-related information, such as contacts, groups, accounts, and
    address books.

- [Creating Applications with Content
    Sharing](feature/app-contentshare-n.md)

    Demonstrates how you can create applications with content sharing
    through application control features or simple NDEF
    message transfer.

- [Creating Applications with Graphics and
    Animation](feature/app-graphics-n.md)

    Demonstrates how you can create applications with graphics and
    animation to draw various shapes, such as squares and polygons, on
    the screen and animate screen elements to change their size,
    position, and color.

- [Creating Applications with
    Multimedia](feature/app-multimedia-n.md)

    Demonstrates how you can create applications with multimedia to play
    and record audio and video, and use the device camera to
    take photos.

- [Creating Applications with Sensors](feature/app-sensor-n.md)

    Demonstrates how you can create applications with the accelerator
    and proximity sensors to monitor user gestures and motions, such as
    phone tilting and accidental touch screen taps when held to the ear
    during a call.

- [Best Practices for Location](feature/best-practice-battery-n.md)

    Demonstrates best practices for reducing battery drain and saving
    battery life when you use the location service.
