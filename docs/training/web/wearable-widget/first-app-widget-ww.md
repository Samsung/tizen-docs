Creating Your First Tizen Wearable Web Widget Application
=========================================================

**Welcome to Tizen wearable Web widget application development!**

A wearable Web application is basically a Web site stored on a wearable
device. You can create it using Web-native languages, such as HTML5,
CSS, and JavaScript.

A widget application is one of the Tizen application types. It can be
shown by specific UI applications (such as the home screen and lock
screen) that can contain widget applications.

**Figure: Widget application on a wearable device**

![Widget application on a wearable
device](./media/widget-app-wearable-widget.png)

Study the following instructions to help familiarize yourself with the
Tizen [Web application development
process](../process/app-dev-process-w.md) as well as using the Tizen
Studio and installing the created application on the emulator or target
device. With the instructions, you can create and run a basic wearable
Web widget application (a Web widget), which displays some text on the
screen with no user interaction:

1.  Before you get started with developing Tizen applications, download
    and install the [Tizen
    Studio](../../../tizen-studio/download/download.md).

    For more information on the installation process, see the
    [installation
    guide](../../../tizen-studio/download/installing-sdk.md).

2.  [Create a wearable Web widget project](#create) using the
    Tizen Studio.

    This step shows how you can use a predesigned project template that
    creates all the basic files and folders required for your project.

3.  [Build the application](#build).

    After you have implemented code for the features you want, this step
    shows how you can build the application to validate and compile
    the code.

4.  [Run the application](#run).

    This step shows how you can run the application on the emulator or a
    real target device.

5.  [Build a UI](#ui).

    This step shows how you can create the application UI.

When you are developing a more complex application, you can take
advantage of the [Web tools included in the Tizen
Studio](../../../tizen-studio/web-tools/cover-web-w.md) to
ease the tasks of creating functionality and designing the application
UI.

Creating a Project <a name="create"></a>
------------------

The following example shows you how to create and configure a basic
wearable Web widget application project in the Tizen Studio. An
application project contains all the files that make up an application.



> **Note** <br>
> For user convenience, standalone widget application packages
are not allowed in the Tizen market place.
Use a standalone widget application for testing purposes. If you want to
publish the application in the Tizen market place, combine it with at
least 1 UI application in the same package. For more information, see
[Developing Multiple Projects as a Combined
Package](../process/app-dev-process-w.md#multi).



The following figure illustrates the application to be created. The
application screen displays the **Hello, Web Widget!** text and no user
interaction is provided.

**Figure: Wearable Web Widget application**

![Wearable Web Widget
application](./media/basic-app-running-ww-widget.png)

To create the application project:

1.  Launch the Tizen Studio.

2.  Make sure the **Web** perspective is selected in the top right
    corner of the Tizen Studio window.

    ![Checking the perspective](./media/change-perspective-w.png)

    If not, select it. If the perspective is not visible, in the Tizen
    Studio menu, select **Window &gt; Perspective &gt; Open
    Perspective &gt; Other &gt; Web**, and click **OK**.

3.  In the Tizen Studio menu, select **File &gt; New &gt; Tizen
    Project**.

    ![Creating a new Tizen Web
    project](./media/create-project-1-w.png)

    The Project Wizard opens.

4.  In the Project Wizard, define the project details.

    The Project Wizard is used to create the basic application skeleton
    with the required folder structure and mandatory files. You can
    easily create different applications by selecting an applicable
    template or sample for the Project Wizard to use.

    a.  Select the **Template** project type and click **Next**.

      ![Selecting the project        type](./media/create-project-wizard-type.png)

    b.  Select the profile (**Wearable**) and version from a drop-down        list and click **Next**.

      The version depends on the platform version you have installed
      and with which you are developing the application.

      ![Selecting the profile and        version](./media/create-project-wizard-version-wearable.png)

    c.  Select the **Web Application** application type and click        **Next**.

      ![Selecting the application        type](./media/create-project-wizard-app-web-wearable.png)

    d.  Select the **Widget** template and click **Next**.

      ![Selecting the        template](./media/create-project-wizard-template-ww-widget.png)

    e.  Define the project properties and click **Finish**.

      You can fill the project name (3-50 characters) and the unique
      package ID. You can also select the location and working sets by        clicking **More properties**.

      ![Defining        properties](./media/create-project-wizard-properties-ww-widget.png)

      The Project Wizard sets up the project, creates the application        files using the default content from the template, and closes.        For more information on the Project Wizard and the available        templates, see [Creating Tizen Projects with Tizen Project        Wizard](../../../tizen-studio/web-tools/project-wizard-w.md).

You can see the created project in the **Project Explorer** view. The
most important files and folders include:

-   `css`: Folder for CSS files used by the application to style its
    content

-   `js`: Folder for JavaScript files used by the application to
    implement its functional logic

-   `config.xml`: Application configuration file used by the platform to
    install and launch the application

-   `icon.png`: Application icon file used by the platform to represent
    the widget

-   `index.html`: Main HTML file for the layout of the application
    screen

-   `preview.png`: Preview of the widget application file that is
    displayed in the widget view on the target.

**Figure: Application in the Project Explorer**

![Application in the Project
Explorer](./media/basic-app-project-explorer-ww-widget.png)



> **Note** <br>
> You can [validate your widget](#validate) and [view and modify
the application configuration](#configuration) in the Web application
configuration editor. In this example, no configuration changes are
required.



Your application project is now ready for further actions. Next, build
the application.

### Checking the Application with the API Validator <a name="validate"></a>

You can validate a Tizen wearable widget application using one of 3
validators:

-   HTML validator
-   CSS validator
-   JS validator

You can enable or disable these validators in the application
preferences: go to **Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Tizen Studio &gt;
WebWidget**, and check the applicable check boxes.

**Figure: Validation preferences**

![Validation preferences](./media/widget-validate-pref-w.png)

The validation is performed automatically when the project or package is
built, or when the application is run.

When the validation is complete, its results are shown in the
**Problems** view. If the view is not displayed, select it from **Window
&gt; Show view &gt; Problems** (keyboard shortcut: **Shift + Alt + Q +
X**).

**Figure: Validation results**

![Validation results](./media/widget-validate-result-w.png)

### Managing the Application Configuration <a name="configuration"></a>

To view and modify the application configuration:

1.  In the **Project Explorer** view, double-click the `config.xml` file
    of the application. The Tizen Studio opens the file in the Web
    application configuration editor.

2.  In the configuration editor, view and modify the configuration
    details using the various tabs:

    ![Configuring the
    application](./media/basic-app-config-widget-w.png)

    -   **Overview**: Define general information, such as the name and
        icon of the application.

    -   **Features**: Define required software and hardware features.
        This information is used for application filtering in the Tizen
        market place.

    -   **Privileges**: Define the security-sensitive APIs or API groups
        accessed and used by the application.

    -   **Policy**: Request network resource permissions to access
        external network resources.

    -   **Localization**: Define localized values for the application
        name, description, and license.

    -   **Preferences**: Define name-value pairs that can be set or
        retrieved through the application.

    -   **Tizen**: Edit the Tizen schema extension properties of
        the application.

    -   **Source**: View and edit the source code of the
        `config.xml` file. Changes made and saved on the other tabs are
        reflected in the source code and vice versa.

        <div class="note">

        **Note** <br>The `config.xml` file must conform to both the XML file
        format and the W3C specification requirements. Editing the file
        in the **Source** tab is intended for advanced users only.

        </div>

3.  To save any changes, in the Tizen Studio menu, select **File &gt;
    Save All**.

For more information on configuring the application, see [Setting the
Web Application
Configuration](../process/setting-properties-w.md#set_widget).

Building Your Application <a name="build"></a>
-------------------------

After you have created the application project, you can implement the
required features. In this example, only the default features from the
project template are used, and no code changes are required.

When your application code is ready, you must build the application. The
building process performs a validation check and compiles your
JavaScript and CSS files.

You can build the application in the following ways:

-   **Automatically**

    The automatic build means that the Tizen Studio automatically
    rebuilds the application whenever you change a source or resource
    file and save the application project.

    To use the automatic build:

    1.  Select the project in the **Project Explorer** view.
    2.  In the Tizen Studio menu, select **Project &gt; Build
        Automatically**.

        ![Using the automatic
        build](./media/build-automatic-widget.png)

        A check mark appears next to the menu option.

    You can toggle the automatic build on and off by reselecting
    **Project &gt; Build Automatically**.

-   **Manually**

    The manual build means that you determine yourself when the
    application is built.

    To manually build the application, right-click the project in the
    **Project Explorer** view and select **Build Project**.

    **Figure: Manually building the application**

    ![Manually building the
    application](./media/build-manual-widget-ww.png)

    Alternatively, you can also select the project in the **Project
    Explorer** view and do one of the following:

    -   In the Tizen Studio menu, select **Project &gt; Build Project**.
    -   Press the **F10** key.

After you have built the application, run it.

Running Your Application <a name="run"></a>
------------------------

You can run the Web widget application on the
[emulator](../process/run-debug-app-w.md#emulator) or a [real target
device](../process/run-debug-app-w.md#target).



> **Note** <br>
> Since the Web Simulator does not support a circular UI, this
topic does not cover the instructions for running the application on the
Web Simulator.



### Running on the Emulator <a name="emulator"></a>

To run the application on the emulator:

1.  Launch an emulator instance in the [Emulator
    Manager](../../../tizen-studio/common-tools/emulator-manager.md):
    a.  In the Tizen Studio menu, select **Tools &gt; Emulator        Manager**.

      ![Emulator Manager](./media/emulator-icon.png)

    b.  In the Emulator Manager, select a wearable emulator from the
      list and click **Launch**.

      If no applicable emulator instance exists, [create a new
      one](../../../tizen-studio/common-tools/emulator-manager.md#create).

      ![Launching the        emulator](./media/emulator-instance-launch-wearable.png)

      The emulator is launched in its own window. You can also see the        new emulator instance in the **Device Manager**. To view the        emulator folder structure, click the arrow next to the        emulator instance.

      ![Emulator](./media/emulator-window-wearable.png)

2.  Generate a security profile.

    Before you run the application, you must [sign your application
    package with a certificate
    profile](../../../tizen-studio/common-tools/certificate-registration.md)
    in the Tizen Studio.

3.  Run the application:
    a.  In the **Project Explorer** view, right-click the project and        select **Run As &gt; Tizen Web Application**.

      ![Running the application](./media/app-run-ww-widget.png)

      Alternatively, you can also select the project in the **Project        Explorer** view and do one of the following:

      -   Press the **Ctrl+F11** key.
      -   Click the run icon in the toolbar.

      If you have created multiple emulator instances, select the
      instance you want from the combo box in the toolbar before
      selecting to run the application. If you select an offline
      emulator, it is automatically launched when you select to run
      the application.

      ![Selecting the emulator to        use](./media/app-run-multiple-emulators.png)

    b.  Confirm that the application launches on the emulator.

      ![Application running in the        emulator](./media/emulator-running-ww-widget.png)



  >    **Note** <br>
  > If the emulator display has switched off, you cannot
        see the application launch. To switch the display on, click the
        **Power** key (in the right bottom corner of the emulator).




  The above screen is shown through the Viewer, to allow you to
      develop a lone widget application for testing purposes.

To see the widget running on the home screen, add the widget
      there:

  a.  Press the **Back** key (in the top right corner of the        emulator device) to return to the home screen (showing a          watch face).

  b.  Swipe the home screen to the right and select **+**.

  c.  Scroll down until you see your widget application, and          select it.

  ![Adding to home        screen](./media/widget-run-add-home-wn.png)

  You can see the added widget on the home screen. To access the
      widget from the home screen, swipe right.

  ![Home screen widget](./media/widget-run-home-wn.png)

  While the application is running, the **Log** view in the Tizen        Studio shows the log, debug, and exception messages from the        methods defined in the log macros. To see the view, in the Tizen        Studio menu, go to **Window &gt; Show View &gt; Log**.

For more information on using the emulator features, see [Using Emulator
Control Keys, Menu, and
Panel](../../../tizen-studio/common-tools/emulator-control-panel.md)
and [Using Extended Emulator
Features](../../../tizen-studio/common-tools/emulator-features.md).

### Running on a Target Device <a name="target"></a>

To run the application on a target device:

1.  Connect the wearable target device to your computer:
    a.  Define settings on the device:
      -   Go to **Settings &gt; Connections**, and switch
            on Bluetooth.

            ![Switch on Bluetooth](./media/emulator-target-bt.png)

            ![Switch on Bluetooth](./media/emulator-target-bt2.png)

      -   Go to **Settings &gt; Connections**, and switch on Wi-Fi.

            The device and the computer must be connected to the same
            Wi-Fi network.

            Note the IP address the device is using.

            ![Switch on Wi-Fi](./media/emulator-target-wifi.png)

      -   Go to **Settings &gt; Gear info**, and switch on the
            debugging mode.

            ![Switch on
            debugging](./media/emulator-target-debug.png)

    b.  In the terminal, enter the following commands:

      ``` {.prettyprint}
        cd tizen-sdk/tools
        ./sdb connect <IP address of Gear S2>
        ```

  Use the IP address you noted before.

  Instead of the terminal, you can also use the [Remote Device
  Manager](../wearable/first-app-ww.md#remote_device) for
  the connection.

    c.  In the first attempt, the connection fails and the device asks        for user confirmation. To allow Gear to read log data, copy        files to and from your computer, and install the application        manually, click the accept mark.

    ![Allow Gear to access        data](./media/remote-allow-gear-ww.png)

    d.  In the **Device Manager**, confirm that the device is connected        (shown in the device list).

    ![Device is connected](./media/remote-connected-ww.png)

2.  Generate an author certificate.

    Before you run the application, you must [sign your application
    package with a certificate
    profile](../../../tizen-studio/common-tools/certificate-registration.md)
    in the Tizen Studio.

3.  Run the application:

    a.  In the **Device Manager**, select the device.

    b.  In **Project Explorer** view, right-click the project and select        **Run As &gt; Tizen Web Application**.

      ![Running the application](./media/app-run-ww-widget.png)

      Alternatively, you can also select the project in the **Project        Explorer** view and do one of the following:

      -   Press the **Ctrl+F11** key.
      -   Click the run icon in the toolbar.

      If you have both a connected device and existing emulator
      instances, select the device from the combo box in the toolbar
      before selecting to run the application.

        ![Selecting the device to
        use](./media/app-run-multiple-emulators.png)

    c.  Confirm that the application launches on the target device.

      Like with the [emulator](#viewer), you must add the widget to
      the home screen before you can see it.



  >  **Note** <br>
  > The application is launched using the default debug
    run configuration. To create and use another configuration:
  > 1.  In the `Project Explorer` view, right-click the project and
        select `Run As > Run Configurations`.
  > 2.  In the `Run Configurations` window, click the
        `New Launch Configuration` icon (![New Launch Configuration
        icon](./media/run-new-config-wn.png)), define the
        configuration details, and launch the application by clicking
        `Run`.

  >   ![Run Configurations
        window](./media/run-configurations-w-widget.png)



Building a Simple UI <a name="ui"></a>
--------------------

The following example is based on a template project for a wearable
widget application, which was introduced in [Creating a
Project](#create).

The template project makes it easy to create your widget application.
Without modification, you can build and run the project. However, it is
important to understand the following template code to customize it.

### Initializing the Widget Application <a name="init"></a>

To initialize the widget application:

1.  Edit the widget application settings in the `config.xml` file.

    The file include various information for the widget application. The
    following code shows an example of the widget content in the file.
    The `<tizen:app-widget>` element indicates the widget settings. If
    the widget requires privileges, add them to the `config.xml` file
    as well.

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <widget xmlns:tizen="http://tizen.org/ns/widgets" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets"
            id="http://yourdomain/HelloWebWidget" version="1.0.0">
       <tizen:app-widget id="0lVPHbX9t6.HelloWebWidget.HelloWebWidget" primary="true">
          <tizen:widget-label>Hello Web Widget!</tizen:widget-label>
          <tizen:widget-content src="index.html">
             <tizen:widget-size preview="preview.png">2x2</tizen:widget-size>
          </tizen:widget-content>
       </tizen:app-widget>
       <tizen:application id="0lVPHbX9t6.HelloWebWidget" package="0lVPHbX9t6" required_version="2.3.2"/>
       <content src="index.html"/>
       <feature name="http://tizen.org/feature/screen.size.normal"/>
       <name>HelloWebWidget</name>
       <tizen:profile name="wearable"/>
    </widget>
    ```

2.  Defining the widget as a standalone or combined (Web application +
    Web widget) application.

    The widget application can be a standalone application, which means
    that it does not connect to a Web application, or it can be combined
    in the same package with a Web UI application. However, you cannot
    publish a standalone widget in the Tizen store.

    When you create a widget application in the Tizen Studio, it is
    always first a standalone application. If you want to connect to a
    Web UI application, you can package the widget with a Web UI
    application:

    a.  Create a Web UI application and the widget application.

    b.  In the **Project Explorer** view, right-click the Web        application, and select **Properties &gt; Tizen Studio &gt;        Package &gt; Multi**, and select the widget to be included in        the package.

    c.  Click **OK**.

    In the following figure, the **Widget** widget application is
    packaged with the **App** UI application. The **Widget** widget
    application indicates this with the **\[with App\]** text.

    ![Widget application
    reference](./media/widget-app-reference-w.png)

### Creating the Widget Application <a name="creating"></a>

The widget application consists of the following folder architecture:

``` {.prettyprint}
widget
   css
      style.css
   images
   js
      main.js
   config.xml
   preview.png
   index.html
```

You can customize the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js` files.
For example, if a JS-based animation effect is needed, add the
`requestAnimationFrame()` method or some other animation library to the
JS file. Similarly, to change the UI elements' visual looks or add
CSS-based effects (including animation), modify the CSS file.

To create the widget application:

1.  Start and initialize the widget application with the
    `index.html` file.

    The starting point is defined in the `config.xml` file's
    `content src` field, which is set to `index.html`.

2.  The `index.html` file includes the element structure of the widget
    application using HTML elements. In addition, it imports the
    JavaScript and CSS files.

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
       <head>
          <meta charset="UTF-8">
          <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css">
          <script src="js/main.js"></script>
       </head>
       <body>
          <div id="page">
             <div id="container">
                <span id="content-text">Hello, Web Widget!</span>
             </div>
          </div>
       </body>
    </html>
    ```

3.  The `style.css` file indicates the style properties of various
    HTML elements.

    The `index.html` file imports the `style.css` file.

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    html, body {
       width: 100%;
       height: 100%;
       margin: 0;
       padding: 0;
    }
    #page {
       background-color: #000;
       color: #fff;
       height: 100%;
       position: relative;
       width: 100%;
    }
    #container {
       left: 50%;
       position: absolute;
       top: 50%;
       transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    }
    #content-text {
       font-weight: bold;
       font-size: 40px;
    }
    ```

4.  The `main.js` file contains the JS-based functions for the widget.

    There are many JS-based functions, such as asynchronous functions,
    JS library, and effects. You can add various features to the widget
    application using JS.
