# Introduction to Tizen .NET Application

Tizen .NET is an exciting new way to develop applications for the Tizen
operating system, running on 50 million Samsung devices, including TVs,
wearables, mobile phones, and many other IoT devices around the world.
The existing Tizen frameworks are either C-based with no advantages of a
managed runtime, or HTML5-based with fewer features and lower
performance than the C-based solution. With Tizen .NET, you can use the
C\# programming language and the Common Language Infrastructure
standards, and benefit from a managed runtime for faster application
development and code execution that is efficient and secure.

To start developing Tizen applications using .NET, see [Creating Your First Tizen .NET Application with Visual Studio](first-app.md).

## Managed Runtime Advantages

A managed runtime offers the following advantages to your application
development:

-   **Faster development**

    Application development is accelerated since the managed runtime
    handles many functions that otherwise have to be coded into
    the application. The Tizen Native API and Tizen Web API already
    provide this benefit.

- **Safer code**

    Managed runtimes can handle, for example, bound checking, type
    safety, garbage collection, memory protection services, and objects
    being invoked directly. The Tizen Web API already provides some of
    these benefits, but not type safety, as JavaScript is not a strongly
    typed language.

- **Lower deployment costs**

    Component-based architecture makes it easier and faster to deploy
    applications in an enterprise environment characterized by multiple
    platforms, devices, and legacy systems.

- **Better quality software**

    Managed runtimes free you to focus on the business logic and code
    specific to the application, while reducing the number of
    coding errors.

- **Cross-platform support**

    The managed code is portable. Tizen .NET applications can have large
    portions of their logic applied to other systems supported by the
    .NET Core and Xamarin.Forms portions of the runtime.

## Tizen .NET Features and Components

Tizen .NET enables you to build .NET applications with Xamarin.Forms and
the Tizen .NET framework. Xamarin.Forms allows you to easily create a
user interface, and the TizenFX API provides numerous interfaces to much
of the hardware that is found in modern TV, mobile, wearable, and IoT
devices.

Tizen .NET consists of the following main components:

-   **.NET Core**

    .NET Core is a general-purpose development platform maintained by
    Microsoft and the .NET community on
    [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/core). It is cross-platform,
    supporting Windows®, macOS, and Linux, and can be used in device,
    cloud, and embedded/IoT scenarios.

    .NET Core is composed of the following parts:

    -   The [.NET runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), which
        provides basic services, such as a type system, assembly
        loading, a garbage collector, and native interop.
    -   A set of [framework
        libraries](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), which provide
        primitive data types, application composition types, and
        fundamental utilities.
    -   A [set of SDK tools](https://github.com/dotnet/cli) and
        [language compilers](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) that
        enable the base developer experience, available in the [.NET
        Core
        SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/sdk).
    -   The dotnet application host, which is used to launch .NET
        Core applications. It selects and hosts the runtime, provides an
        assembly loading policy, and launches the application. The
        application host is also used to launch SDK tools similarly.  


- **Xamarin.Forms as a UI framework**

    Xamarin.Forms is a cross-platform UI toolkit that allows you to
    efficiently create native user interface layouts that can be shared
    across iOS, Android™, Windows Phone, and Universal Windows
    Platform applications.

- **TizenFX API**

    Tizen .NET supports C\# APIs, which expose Tizen-specific features:

    -   **Tizen.Account** provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
        account management functionality and the OAuth Core RFC
        6749 protocol.
    -   **Tizen.Applications** provides the Tizen application framework,
        including application state change events, inter-application
        messaging, and notification services.
    -   **Tizen.Common** provides predefined color names.
    -   **Tizen.Content** provides content management services, such as
        file and media downloading, storing and indexing audio and video
        content, and associating content types with helper applications.
    -   **Tizen.Location** manages geographical location services
        and geofencing.
    -   **Tizen.Maps** provides methods to create
        map-aware applications.
    -   **Tizen.Messaging** provides methods to receive
        push notifications.
    -   **Tizen.Multimedia** interacts with media services, including
        audio playback, recording, and device policy.
    -   **Tizen.Network** controls connectivity devices and retrieves
        network information.
    -   **Tizen.NUI** (Natural User Interface) is a toolkit for creating
        applications with a rich GUI. The applications can run on a
        range of Tizen devices.
    -   **Tizen.Security** provides access to secure storage for
        passwords, keys, certificates, and other sensitive data.
    -   **Tizen.Sensor** provides sensor types and sensor information.
    -   **Tizen.System** provides device-specific services, including
        status, system information and settings, feedback, and sensor
        control and access.
    -   **Tizen.Telephony** provides call, modem, network, and
        SIM information.
    -   **Tizen.Uix** provides methods to recognize speech, synthesize
        voice from text, and play synthesized sound data.
    -   **Tizen.Log** provides methods to print log messages to the
        Tizen logging system.
    -   **Tizen.Tracer** provides methods to write trace messages to the
        system trace buffer.
