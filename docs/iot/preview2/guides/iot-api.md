# IoT APIs

The Tizen IoT API provides a common set of interfaces allowing you to build compelling IoT device applications which achieve native performance. The characteristics include:

-   **Common set API**, which means that the Tizen IoT API is based on the Tizen 4.0 common profile. The API supports the common set of mobile, wearable, and TV profiles and allows you to make IoT applications, such as network audio applications.
-   **Available platform binaries**, which allow you to efficiently create an IoT application. Tizen Common Headed binaries for Raspberry Pi 3 and ARTIK 530 have passed the API test verification, which means that you can create IoT applications with a productive quality.

In Preview 1, the Tizen IoT API releases only the native "C" API. Other convenient language types for the API are to be considered in the future.

The following table lists the IoT-specific Tizen platform API group.

| [Things SDK API](things-api.md) | The SmartThings&trade; Things SDK APIs help you to create new Things applications on IoT devices. For the full specification, see the [Things SDK API Reference](https://developer.tizen.org/dev-guide/things-sdk/4.0). |
| [Peripheral I/O API](peripheral-io-api.md) | The Peripheral I/O native APIs are designed specifically for making  IoT devices control peripherals, such as actuators and sensors. For the  full specification, see the [Tizen Common Headed API Reference](https://developer.tizen.org/dev-guide/tizen-iot-headed/4.0) and [Tizen Common Headless API Reference](https://developer.tizen.org/dev-guide/tizen-iot-headless/4.0). |
