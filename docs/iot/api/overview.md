# IoT API Reference

The Tizen IoT API provides a common set of interfaces allowing you to build compelling IoT device applications that achieve native performance. 

The Tizen common set API is based on the Tizen Native API. The API supports the common set of wearable, TV, and mobile profiles and allows you to make IoT applications, such as network audio applications.  Also, the Things SDK provides you an easy and configurable option to build and deploy your own devices quickly.

The following table lists the IoT-specific Tizen platform API group.
