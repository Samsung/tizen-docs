            | C -   Callin Program      :                                           |
            | D -  Callout Program      :                                           |
            | E -    Bps/Par/Bits       : 115200 8N1                                |
            | F - Hardware Flow Control : No                                        |
            | G - Software Flow Control : No                                        |
            ```

            In the serial shell, log in with `root/tizen`:

            ```
            localhost login: root
            Password: tizen
            Welcome to Tizen
            ```

        -   PuTTY example:

            Download PuTTY from the Internet and launch PuTTY.

            ![PuTTY Config](media/putty_config.png)

            To configure PuTTY:

            1.  Select `Serial` connection type.
            2.  Enter the serial line number for the board connected to your computer (it can be COM`N` where `N` is a natural number such as COM1, COM4, and so on) in the `Serial line` field.
            3.  Type 115200 in the `Speed` field.
            4.  Click `Open`.

            In the serial shell, log in with `root/tizen`:

            ```
            localhost login: root
            Password: tizen
            Welcome to Tizen
            ```

3.  For the SDB connection:
    1.  Connect the host computer to the Pi through an Ethernet cable.

        > **Note**
        >
        > If Ethernet ports are not available in the host computer or the Pi, you can also use an `Ethernet-to-USB` dongle.


    2.  Set a new network interface in the host computer as shown in the following figures. This is a one time activity:
        -   Linux computer:

        ![Linux Network Configuration](media/network_setting.png)

        ![Windows Network Configuration](media/win_net_config.png)

        If you are using the **Ethernet-to-USB** dongle, you must install the proper driver for the dongle. If the network cable is connected correctly, you can find a new connection in Network and Sharing Center. In the new connection, enter Properties of IPv4, and configure as shown in the Windows computer figure.

4.  Verify the IP address for eth0.

    ```
    ifconfig
    ```

    If the IP address for eth0 is 192.168.1.11, go to step 5. If not, set an IP address for the SDB connection in the serial shell of the Pi using the `ifconfig` command:

    ```
    ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.11
    ```

5.  Connect Smart Development Bridge (SDB) in the Linux shell (Linux) or Command window (Windows) of the host computer:

    ```
    sdb connect 192.168.1.11
    sdb root on
    ```

    For example, for Linux computer:

    ```
    ~$ sdb connect 192.168.1.11
    * server not running. starting it now on port 26099 *
    * server started successfully *
    connecting to 192.168.1.11:26101 ...
    connected to 192.168.1.11:26101
    ~$ sdb root on
    Switched to 'root' account mode
    ~$
    ```

6.  Enter the `sdb help` command in the Linux shell (Linux) or Command window (Windows) of the host computer, for more information.
    > **Note**
    >
    > `sdb` execution file is available in the `tools` sub-directory of the directory where Tizen Studio is installed.


### Installing Drivers

1.  Connect Smart Development Bridge (SDB) as described in [Connecting the board to the PC](#connecting-the-board-to-the-pc).
2.  Install the connectivity drivers for each board:
    -   **Raspberry Pi 3**
        1.  Download the plugin zip file from the **Raspberry Pi 3(5.0) Plugin** section at <http://developer.samsung.com/tizendevice/firmware> and follow the instructions.

            ![Raspberry Pi 3(5.0) Plugin section](media/wifi_driver_rpi3_5.0.png)

        2.  For the case of the Linux shell (Linux), run the `sh` script given in the instructions. For example:

            ```
            $ ./RPI3_plugin_tizen5.0.sh
            ```

        3.  For the case of the Command window (Windows), run the `bat` script given in the instructions. For example:

## Tips

### IoT Setup Manager Details

#### IoT Setup Manager Features

-   **Saved Profiles:** You can save and retrieve the configuration profiles for easy flashing.
-   **Three Steps Flashing:**
    1.  Select the profile.
    2.  Select your SD Card.
    3.  Click **Burn**.
-   **Automatic Network Connection:** You can enter the Wi-Fi (SSID and password) or the Ethernet (static information) details to allow the device to automatically connect to the local network upon startup.

#### Prerequisites

##### Operating System

IoT Setup Manager supports the following operating systems:

-   Windows 7 and later (64 and 32 bit)
-   Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and later (64 and 32 bit)

##### Environment

IoT Setup Manager requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.8 or later to be installed on your computer.

> **Note**
>
> You must only have the Oracle JRE installed on your computer.


Verify whether JRE is installed on your computer. To do so, open the shell terminal in Ubuntu or the command-line prompt in Windows and run the following commands:

```
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_112"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_112-b15)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.112-b15, mixed mode)
```

If JRE is installed, the output is similar for both Ubuntu and Windows. If `Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment` does not appear in the output or if an error occurs, then this implies, JRE is not installed on your computer.

##### Ubuntu Tools

If you are using Ubuntu, the following packages must be installed in addition to the IoT Setup Manager:

-   rpm2cpio
-   cpio

If the packages are not installed, run the following command to install a package:

```
sudo apt-get install package-name
```

#### Installing IoT Setup Manager

Ensure that you have installed [Tizen Studio](#installing-tizen-studio).

To install the IoT Setup Manager using the Package Manager available in Tizen Studio:

1.  Open Tizen Studio and go to **Tools > Package Manager**.
2.  Click **Extension SDK** and verify whether the IoT Setup Manager appears in the list of available packages.
3.  Click **install** for **IoT Setup Manager** to install the IoT Setup Manager Extension.
4.  Start Tizen Studio. If Tizen Studio is already running, close and restart it.

#### IoT Setup Manager fields

![IoT Setup Manager Main](media/iot_setup_manager_main_window.png)


The IoT Setup Manager view contains the following fields:

-   **Select burning profile**

    You can select one of the available profiles from the **Select burning profile** drop-down list, to avoid creating or modifying profiles every time. Additionally, you can copy the flashing profile to the Manager directory. This enables the application to recognize the profile on the next start.

-   **Create**

    To create a new flashing profile.

-   **Edit**

    To modify the existing profile.

-   **Select Drive**

    Insert an SD card and wait until it appears in the drop-down list.

-   **Burn**

    Click **Burn** and wait until the flashing routine is finished. This may take few minutes and you may have to enter your supervisor password, which is required to access the SD card.

If you want to modify the exist profile, select **Edit**.

![IoT Setup Manager Edit](media/ism_edit_rpi3.png)

The IoT Setup Manager edit view contains the following fields:

-   **Profile name**

    Specify a profile name, for example, RPI3-headless.

-   **Target**

    Select the board and image type from the drop-down list.

    -   RPI3_HEADLESS: SD-card-bootable headless image for Raspberry Pi 3 board.

-   **Boot image**

    Browse for the Tizen Boot image available on your hard drive. You must select proper images depending on the board.

-   **Platform image**

    Browse for the Tizen Platform image available on your hard drive. You must select proper images depending on the board.

-   **RPM bundles** (optional)

    Browse for the folder that contains the Tizen RPMs on your hard drive. You do not have to enter the details in this field.

-   **Network configuration** (optional)

    Enter the Wi-Fi (SSID and password) or the Ethernet (static) details to allow the device to automatically connect to the local network after startup. If you do not want to set up the network, you can clear the **Wifi** and the **Ethernet** check box.

#### Tips and Guidelines

-   Profiles are an easy way to store image paths and network configuration information. After you save a profile, you can use it to flash your SD Card instead of specifying all information again.
-   While creating or editing a profile, ensure that the boot images, platform images, and the rpms (if selected) match the target device.
-   Ensure that there are no white spaces in the boot image, platform image, and the rpm folder paths.
-   Place RPMs in a separate directory, which does not contain any other files or directories and select the directory path for creating the profile.

        >     brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 22  9 22 14:59 /dev/sdb6
        >     brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 23  9 22 14:59 /dev/sdb7
        >     ```
        >
        >     The new `sdX` node (where X is a letter) is the device node for the SD card.
        >
        >     In this example, the device node for the SD card is `sdb`.

    2.  Download and unzip the [flash-sdcard-rpi3.tar.gz](embedded-files/flash-sdcard-rpi3.tar.gz) script file. Ensure that this script and all other downloaded files are in the same directory.

        > **Note**
        >
        > The file extension of the downloaded file is `.tar_.gz`. Modify it to `.tar.gz` before unzipping the file.

    3.  Run the `flash-sdcard.sh` script with the device node and binary version:

        ```
        $ sudo ./flash-sdcard.sh <SD card device node>
        ```

        For example:

        ```
        $ sudo ./flash-sdcard.sh /dev/sdb
        ```

3.  Open the Smart Development Bridge (SDB) connection. For more information, see [Setting up Raspberry Pi 3](#setting-up-raspberry-pi-3).

    > **Note**
    >
