## Tips

### IoT Setup Manager Details

#### IoT Setup Manager Features

-   **Saved Profiles:** You can save and retrieve the configuration profiles for easy flashing.
-   **Three Steps Flashing:**
    1.  Select the profile.
    2.  Select your SD Card.
    3.  Click **Burn**.
-   **Automatic Network Connection:** You can enter the Wi-Fi (SSID and password) or the Ethernet (static information) details to allow the device to automatically connect to the local network upon startup.

#### Prerequisites

##### Operating System

IoT Setup Manager supports the following operating systems:

-   Windows 7 and later (64 and 32 bit)
-   Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and later (64 and 32 bit)

##### Environment

IoT Setup Manager requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.8 or later to be installed on your computer.

> **Note**
>
> You must only have the Oracle JRE installed on your computer.


Verify whether JRE is installed on your computer. To do so, open the shell terminal in Ubuntu or the command-line prompt in Windows and run the following commands:

```
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_112"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_112-b15)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.112-b15, mixed mode)
```

If JRE is installed, the output is similar for both Ubuntu and Windows. If `Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment` does not appear in the output or if an error occurs, then this implies, JRE is not installed on your computer.

##### Ubuntu Tools

If you are using Ubuntu, the following packages must be installed in addition to the IoT Setup Manager:

-   rpm2cpio
-   cpio

If the packages are not installed, run the following command to install a package:

```
sudo apt-get install package-name
```

#### Installing IoT Setup Manager

Ensure that you have installed [Tizen Studio](#Installing-Tizen-Studio).

To install the IoT Setup Manager using the Package Manager available in Tizen Studio:

1.  Open Tizen Studio and go to **Tools > Package Manager**.
2.  Click **Extension SDK** and verify whether the IoT Setup Manager appears in the list of available packages.
3.  Click **install** for **IoT Setup Manager** to install the IoT Setup Manager Extension.
4.  Start Tizen Studio. If Tizen Studio is already running, close and restart it.


#### IoT Setup Manager fields

![IoT Setup Manager Main](media/iot_setup_manager_main_window.png)


The IoT Setup Manager view contains the following fields:

-   **Select burning profile**

    You can select one of the available profiles from the **Select burning profile** drop-down list, to avoid creating or modifying profiles every time. Additionally, you can copy the flashing profile to the Manager directory. This enables the application to recognize the profile on the next start.

-   **Create**

    To create a new flashing profile.

-   **Edit**

    To modify the existing profile.

-   **Select Drive**

    Insert an SD card and wait until it appears in the drop-down list.

-   **Burn**

    Click **Burn** and wait until the flashing routine is finished. This may take few minutes and you may have to enter your supervisor password, which is required to access the SD card.

If you want to modify the exist profile, select **Edit**.

![IoT Setup Manager Edit](media/iot_setup_manager_edit_window.png)

The IoT Setup Manager edit view contains the following fields:

-   **Profile name**

    Specify a profile name, for example, ARTIK530-headless.

-   **Target**

    Select the board and image type from the drop-down list.

    -   RPI3_HEADLESS: SD-card-bootable headless image for Raspberry Pi 3 board
    -   ARTIK530_HEADLESS: SD-card-bootable headless image for ARTIK 530 board
    -   ARTIK530_HEADED: SD-card-bootable headed image for ARTIK 530 board
    -   ARTIK530_HEADLESS_INSTALLABLE: eMMC-bootable headless binary for ARTIK 530 board. When you start the board with SD card, the image is installed into eMMC.
    -   ARTIK530_HEADED_INSTALLABLE: eMMC-bootable headled binary for ARTIK 530 board. When you start the board with SD card, the image is installed into eMMC.
-   **Boot image**

    Browse for the Tizen Boot image available on your hard drive. You must select proper images depending on the board. 

-   **Platform image**

    Browse for the Tizen Platform image available on your hard drive. You must select proper images depending on the board. 

-   **RPM bundles** (optional)

    Browse for the folder that contains the Tizen RPMs on your hard drive. You do not have to enter the details in this field.

-   **Network configuration** (optional)

    Enter the Wi-Fi (SSID and password) or the Ethernet (static) details to allow the device to automatically connect to the local network after startup. If you do not want to set up the network, you can clear the **Wifi** and the **Ethernet** check box.

#### Tips and Guidelines

-   Profiles are an easy way to store image paths and network configuration information. After you save a profile, you can use it to flash your SD Card instead of specifying all information again.
-   While creating or editing a profile, ensure that the boot images, platform images, and the rpms (if selected) match the target device.
-   Ensure that there are no white spaces in the boot image, platform image, and the rpm folder paths.
-   Place RPMs in a separate directory, which does not contain any other files or directories and select the directory path for creating the profile.
-   ARTIK530_HEADLESS_INSTALLABLE and ARTIK530_HEADED_INSTALLABLE profiles are used for writing images from SD Card to eMMC.
