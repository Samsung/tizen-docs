# Testing with SmartThings App

With the SmartThings app, you can test the ARTIK 530 or Raspberry Pi 3 boards developed by you. To test the boards:

1.  Launch the **SmartThings** app.

    > **Note**
    >
    >  The SmartThings app (previously known as Samsung Connect application) is preloaded on Samsung devices from Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8 onwards. Additionally, if the phone is based on Android version 6.0 or later, you can download the SmartThings app from the Google Play Store app. The SmartThings app version must be `1.7.02-45` or higher.

2.  In **Dashboard**, tap the settings icon (3 dots at the top right).
3.  Tap **Settings** from the drop-down list. The **SMARTTHINGS SETTINGS** screen appears.
4.  Long press **About SmartThings** for more than five seconds. The **DEVELOPER OPTIONS** appears.
5.  Toggle **Developer mode** to turn on the developer mode.
6.  Tap **Devices**.
7.  Tap **ADD DEVICES**.
8.  Find the `deviceName` defined in the JSON file and tap it.

After you have completed the steps, you can control the device.
