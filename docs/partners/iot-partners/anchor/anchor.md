# Tizen IoT with Anchor SoM Module

> The Fastest Way to design your IoT Applications

## Anchor5

**Anchor5** is a system-on-module(SoM) built in a 32-bit RISC application processor that is based on an quad-core ARM® quad Cortex®-A9 cores architecture with max 1.4GHz speed, containing DRAM provided 6.4 GB/s memory bandwidth with flash memory, camera and display interfaces displayed Full HD, a full complement of digital I/O and analog inputs, and world class wireless connectivity with IEEE802.11a/b/g/n/ac and Bluetooth(Classic+BLE) inside a ultra compact package that is just 38x45mm.
The scalable processing power of the Anchor5 makes it ideally suited for video/image processing tasks and provides the best 3D graphics performance with wide range of APIs, such as OpenGL ES1.1, 2.0.
The native dual display supports Full HD resolution with Superior 3D performance of  LCD display and progressive Full HDTV throughout HDMI, simultaneously.
The hardware based Secure Element works with the ARM® TrustZone® and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to provide enhanced end-to-end security.

With excellent performance and most popular connectivity like WiFi and Bluetooth, Anchor5 is the perfect choice for home automation and industrial equipment, and even IoT devices, while providing effective price / performance capability.
