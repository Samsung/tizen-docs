# Tizen Extension Library

## What is Tizen Extension Library?

The Tizen eXtension Library (TizenX) is a collection of modular, open-source libraries that enhance and extend the Tizen platform.

Unlike built-in platform APIs, TizenX libraries are unbundled from the operating system and delivered **independently via NuGet**. This approach allows developers to adopt new features, UI components, and performance improvements at their own pace, free from the long OS update cycle.

> **Extend. Experience. Evolve.**

TizenX provides you with ready-to-use components, productivity tools, and pre-integrated functionalities that simplify app development and boost performance.

## Why TizenX?

 * **Modern .NET Design**
    All libraries comply with the .NET Design Guidelines and follow the latest architectural patterns.

 * **Performance and Optimization**
    Benefit from built-in memory and performance optimizations designed for the Tizen platform.

 * **Enhanced Productivity**
    Build apps faster with commercial-level UI components, declarative UI helpers, enhanced layouts, and powerful development tools.

 * **Flexible and Modular**
    TizenX is divided into independent modules. You can include only the libraries you need, keeping your application lightweight.

 * **Rapid Updates**
    Receive the latest features and bug fixes through NuGet without waiting for a new Tizen OS release.
