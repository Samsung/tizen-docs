# Welcome to Tizen Studio
The Tizen Studio platform is based on a new version of Eclipse, so you can experience a stable, lightweight, and consistent user interface that is unique to the Tizen development environment. With the Tizen Studio, you can select and install only those platforms and profiles you need.

The [Tizen studio repository](https://review.tizen.org/gerrit/#) is where we do development and there are many ways you can participate in the project, for example:
- Submit bugs and feature requests and help us verify as they are checked in
- Tizen Studio extension development
- Contributed to Tizen studio
