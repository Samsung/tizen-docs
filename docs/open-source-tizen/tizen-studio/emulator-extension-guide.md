# Emulator Extension Development Guide

You can develop various extensions for the emulator: QEMU, kernel, Emulator Manager, and Emulator Control Panel extensions.

## Developing QEMU Extensions

To develop a QEMU extension:

1. Develop your extension in a separate source directory.  
   For ease of management, you can use `git submodule` to handle the `QEMU` Git repository as a subdirectory.
2. Build the extension:
    1. Add your extension source code to a subdirectory under `<QEMU>/tizen/src/`.  
        You can use `git submodule` to create the subdirectory from your source code directory, or link to it using a symbolic link.
    2. Prepare the `configure` script.  
        Use the existing `emulator_configure.sh` file in the `<QEMU>/tizen/` directory as a template.
    3. Run the `configure` script with the argument `--extension-path = [extension directory]`, where the extension directory is a relative path starting from `<QEMU>/tizen/src`.
    4. Run the `make` command with the `<QEMU>/tizen/Makefile` file.  
        If you used `git submodule` to manage the `QEMU` repository as a subdirectory, it can be convenient to create a wrapper `Makefile` in the parent directory.
3. After you have built and tested your extension, push your code to the `QEMU` Git repository.

        
## Developing Kernel Extensions

To develop a kernel extension:

1. Develop your extension in a separate source directory.  
   For ease of management, you can use `git submodule` to handle the `emulator-kernel` Git repository as a subdirectory.
2. Build the extension:
    1. Add your extension source code to a subdirectory under `<emulator-kernel>/drivers/maru/`.  
       You can use `git submodule` to create the subdirectory from your source code directory, or link to it using a symbolic link.
    2. Prepare the `defconfig` file.  
       Use the existing `defconfig` file as a template.  
       You can use a script to set the extension path at build time, or if the extension path is fixed, it can be hardcoded in the `defconfig` file `CONFIG_MARU_EXTENSION_SOURCE` and `CONFIG_MARU_EXTENSION_SOURCE_PATH` variables.
    3. Run the `make` command with the `defconfig` file.  
       If you used `git submodule` to manage the `emulator-kernel` repository as a subdirectory, it can be convenient to create a wrapper `Makefile` in the parent directory.
3. After you have built and tested your extension, push your code to the `emulator-kernel` Git repository.

## Developing Emulator Manager Extensions

Before developing Emulator Manager extensions, you must understand the structure of the Emulator Manager. The Emulator Manager has the following components:
- `em-lib.jar` manages the common parts of the UI and CLI. It loads the plugin `.jar` file and the default property `.xml` file.
- `em-3.0-ui.jar` contains the UI source, which is implemented using JavaFX. It loads the emulator UI template `.xml` file.
- `em-cli.jar` contains the CLI source.

**Figure: Emulator Manager structure**

In Emulator Manager plugins:
- Each platform has separate files for its UI items and emulator options.
- Each profile has a separate plugin.  
  For example:
  - `em-plugin-mobile.jar`
  - `em-plugin-wearable.jar`
- The `template` directory contains `.xml` files that define platform-specific UI and property values.  
  For example:
  - `X86-standard.xml` (default property)
  - `X86-standard-template-v2.xml` (UI template)

Extension points and their associated classes allow you to extend the features of the Emulator Manager:
- The `Item-Factory` class extends property view items in the UI.
  - Extension point: `org.tizen.emulator.manager.ui.item.ViewItemFactory`
- The `Option-Factory-v2` class extends launch options.
  - Extension point: `org.tizen.emulator.manager.vms.option.IOptionFactory`
- The `Platform-Resource-Selector` class selects whether to use platform resources.

You must specify the extension class in the `MANIFEST.MF` file of the plugin.

The following figure describes how extension plugins implement new features in the Emulator Manager.

For example, you can create a UI extension to modify the launch options. This is implemented using the `org.tizen.emulator.manager.vms.option.Option` extension point. After creating a class instance, you can extend the `OptionFactoryV2` class by using `MakeOptionList` to add a new option to the Common option list, or `addOption` to add a new option to a specific list item.

## Developing Emulator Control Panel Extensions

The Emulator Control Panel extensions use 2 Git repositories:
- Lib, UI, and CLI code: `sdk/emulator/emulator-control-panel`
- Device code: `sdk/tools/emulator-control-panel-devices`

To build an extension:

1. Copy the external binaries.
2. Copy the following binaries from `tizen-sdk/tools/emulator/bin` to the 2 `libs` folders in your project:
    - `args4j`, `jfxrt`, `jline`, `json-simple`, and `protobuf`
3. Build the code:
   - In the case of `lib`, `ui`, and `cli` libraries, to build them all at once, enter the `ant` shell command at the top level of your project.
   - In the case of devices:
     - When building is complete, copy the built `libecp`, `emulator-control-panel.jar`, and `emulator-control-panel-cli.jar` files to `libs` in the devices project directory.
     - To build the `mobile`, `wearable`, and `tv` profiles all at once, enter the `ant` shell command at the top level of your project. To build a specific profile only, you can specify, for example, `ant -f ECP-DEVICE/build_mobile.xml`.
4. If you configure devices separately, you only need to push changes to the `emulator-control-panel-devices` repository.
5. When building is complete, move the following files:
    - `lib`, `ui`, and `cli` to `sdk/tools/emulator/bin`
    - Device `xml` and `jar` files to `platforms/<version>/<profile>/emulator-resources/plugins`
        - You must also rename the `.jar` file.

To execute the extension in Eclipse:

1. Launch the Eclipse IDE.
2. Import all the project files.
3. In the run configuration, set the program arguments.  
   For example:  
   ```
   vm_name=w-0906-1 base_port=26100 platform_version=tizen-2.3.2 profile=wearable
   ```
   The platform version and profile are used in the directory names:
   ```
   <tizen-sdk>/platforms/<platform_version>/<profile>
   ```
4. In the run configuration, enter the following VM arguments:
    - `-Ddevelop`, `sdk.info` file is found based on the SDK installation path specified in `FilePath.java`
    - For example: `emulator-control-panel/ECP-LIB`
      - `ln -s ~/tizen-studio/sdk.info sdk.info`

### Changes

- Use JavaFX to implement UI features. SWT is not compatible with the existing code (including XML).
- Rename the plugin `ecp-plugin.xml` file to `ecp-plugin-<profile>-<version>.xml`.
- Change the package structure:
    - Separate the code to the `emulator-control-panel` and `emulator-control-panel-devices` Git repositories.
    - Change the executable file under platforms to Tools.
- Change the XML form.
