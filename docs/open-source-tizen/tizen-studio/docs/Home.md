## An Intruduction to Tizen Studio

The Tizen Studio is a comprehensive set of tools for developing Tizen native and Web applications. It consists of an IDE, Emulator, toolchain, sample code, and documentation. Tizen Studio runs on WindowsÂ® and Ubuntu, as well as macOS. Tizen applications can be developed without relying on the official Tizen Studio, as long as the application complies with the Tizen packaging rules.

To develop your applications, use the set of tools provided by the Tizen Studio:

### [Download](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-studio/download)
Learn about installing and updating the Tizen Studio. You may need to install additional packages to develop applications for various platforms.
   
### [Native Tools](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-studio/native-tools)
Learn about the available native application development tools. Native applications are developed using the C programming language. You can create an application project, edit the code to meet your needs, and run the application on the emulator or a target device.
    
### [Web Tools](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-studio/web-tools)
Learn about the available Web application development tools. Web applications are developed using the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS languages. You can create an application project, edit the code to meet your needs, and run the application on the emulator, simulator, or a target device.

### [Platform Tools](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-studio/platform-tools)
Learn about the platform development environment that helps you develop preloaded platform applications, platform libraries, and device drivers in Ubuntu.
    
### [RT IDE](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-studio/rt-ide)
Learn about the Tizen Studio for RT and how you can develop lightweight RTOS-based applications.
    
### [Extension SDK](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-studio/extension-sdk)
Learn about monetizing your Tizen applications by offering in-app purchases and using the InMobi Tizen Ad SDK.

The Tizen Studio contains many tools familiar from the old Tizen SDK, but with some improvements. The following list describes the main changes:

### Installer and Package Manager

 These tools allow you to install, update, and maintain the Tizen Studio. You can select and install the platforms and profiles you need, and receive continuous updates. The tools provide you with accurate information so you can configure the development environment easily.

### Tizen Studio development environment

This component, where development of Tizen applications takes place, has a unified Tizen theme, provides a fast development environment, and improves ease of use through sorting the menu in a logical order for application development tasks and expanding the toolbar icons.

In addition, the Tizen Studio provides accurate information in a consistent manner to minimize the difficulties you can encounter while using it.

### Native UI Builder

This tool provides assistance for developing native Tizen applications. It allows for visual development of UI applications using a WYSIWYG (What You See is What You Get) editor, and it helps you understand Tizen native UI development and the UI hierarchy. The application UI screen can be configured easily with this editor.

### Emulator

This tool helps you develop and debug Tizen applications without an actual Tizen device. You can select the platform, profile, and device features that you need and run applications on an emulator. In addition, through the Emulator Control Panel (ECP), you can simulate events in your application and see how the application responds.

### Profiling tool

The Tizen Studio provides profiling assistance for application optimization. By using the Dynamic Analyzer, the status of the device, such as its processor usage, memory usage, and UI events, can be measured and analyzed to help you optimize your Tizen application.
