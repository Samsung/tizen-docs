### Tizen IDE extension overview
- The Tizen IDE is based on [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) and can be extended based on Eclipse's plugin extension platform.
- Therefore, the extensible part of the Eclipse platform can contribute.
    - Technically, all of the functions of Tizen IDE that provide extension points in the Eclipse Platform can be extended and added / changed.
    - For example Menu, Context Menu, Toolbar, View, Editor etc ...
- Note that the Tizen IDE has modified some of the icon images for Tizen Studio identity and modified some of the Eclipse platform upstream sources to customize unnecessary parts of menus and settings, so some extension points may not work properly . 

### Tizen IDE extension Development Guide
- Tizen IDE extension development method is basically same as Eclipse plugin development method.
