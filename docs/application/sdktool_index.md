# Tizen SDK Tools User Manual

## Index of Tools
### API and Privilege Checker
Helps detect undefined and unused privileges in Tizen .NET applications, enabling developers to resolve issues at compile time using Visual Studio's Quick Actions for efficient manifest file updates and error resolution.
### ASAN(Address Sanitizer)
A tool for detecting memory errors in Tizen Native apps, such as out-of-bounds accesses, use-after-free, double free, and invalid free, by adding extra code during compilation to prevent crashes and ensure memory safety.
### ASAN/LSAN in VSCode
This is a user manual on how to use ASAN/LSAN in the Visual Studio Code environment.
### ASAN/LSAN in VS
This is a user manual on how to use ASAN/LSAN in the Visual Studio environment.
### Certificate Manager
Simplifies the process of managing and configuring certificates for Tizen applications, ensuring secure development and deployment.
### CLI(Command Line Interface)
Provides functionalities for developing Tizen applications without Tizen Studio. It includes the entire development process from creating the project to running the application.
### Core Profiler
Allows developers to analyze application performance and memory usage by running emulators, starting profilers, and visualizing detailed data through various views like flame graphs, allocation graphs, and histograms for efficient debugging and optimization.
### Device Manager
A standalone tool that helps developers manage connected Tizen devices or emulators, enabling file operations, log viewing, and debugging for efficient application development and testing.
### Dotnet CLI(Command Line Interface)
Provides a command-line interface for developing Tizen .NET applications, enabling project creation, restoration, building, cleaning, and certificate generation, with options for setting configurations and managing dependencies for efficient development without an IDE.
### Dotnet Core Diagnostics for VSCode
Provides developers with powerful utilities to diagnose and analyze Tizen .NET applications, offering features like memory usage tracking, performance tracing, and crash dump analysis for efficient debugging and optimization.
### Dotnet Core Diagnostics for VS
Provides developers with powerful utilities to diagnose Tizen .NET applications, offering features like memory analysis, performance tracing, and crash dump analysis for efficient debugging and optimization.
### Emulator
A tool that allows developers to test applications on virtual devices with features similar to real devices, providing full system emulation, event simulation, and hardware acceleration for efficient development and testing.
### Install Tizen App
Simplifies building and deploying Tizen applications (Native, Web, or .NET) directly to selected emulators, supporting .tpk, .rpk, and .wgt formats with minimal setup and a single click for efficient development and testing.
### LSAN(Leak Sanitizer)
A tool for detecting runtime memory leaks in Tizen Native apps by instrumenting code during compilation, helping developers identify memory leaks and ensure efficient memory management for safer application execution.
### Manifest Editor
Allows developers to visually modify the tizen-manifest.xml file, defining application details and configurations through a structured form editor for easier management and customization.
### Memory Profiler for Dotnet
A tool that analyzes memory usage of Tizen .NET applications, providing real-time insights into physical memory usage, garbage collection events, application events, and detailed allocation information for efficient debugging and optimization. To profiling in a version below Tizen 9.0, please refer to the Old version of Memory Profiler
### Package Manager
A tool for managing software packages, allowing users to install, update, and remove software efficiently.
### Project Wizard
Allows developers to create Tizen .NET application projects by selecting templates (Blank App, ElmSharp-Beta, Tizen.NUI, or Class Library) and profiles, setting project properties like name and package ID, and automatically generating basic functionalities and default files for efficient development.
### SDB(Smart Development Bridge)
A versatile command-line tool for managing Tizen devices, enabling file transfers, shell commands, application installation/uninstallation, port forwarding, and log monitoring for efficient development and debugging.
### Tizen Activity Bar
Provides a streamlined interface for managing and accessing Tizen development tools and features within Visual Studio Code.
### Tizen-Core CLI(Command Line Interface)
Provides functionalities for developing Tizen applications using the terminal. It includes the entire development process from creating the project to running the application.
### Unit Test and Code Coverage
Helps developers assess code quality by executing Native unit tests and analyzing code coverage, displaying results in a tree view for convenient review and navigation to failure locations in the source code within the VS Code Extension.
### WASM(Web Assembly)
Involves creating a web project, integrating WASM modules, building the modules, and running the application on Tizen targets, supported by Visual Studio Code extensions and Tizen Studio for efficient development and debugging.
