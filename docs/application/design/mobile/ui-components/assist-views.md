# Assist Views

Assist views are used to provide the user with additional information to complement the main content. The following UI components are assist views:

-   [Pop-up](#pop-up)
-   [Toast pop-up](#toast-pop-up)
-   [Context pop-up](#context-pop-up)
-   [More menu](#more-menu)

## Pop-up

To learn how to implement a pop-up, see [Popup](../../../native/guides/ui/efl/component-popup-m.md).

## Floating Action Button

The floating action button allows the user to take action at any point on a screen. The button does not scroll with the content, because it is vertically fixed on the screen. However, the user can horizontally drag or flick the button to adjust its horizontal position.
