# Presentation Views



Presentation views are used to display the main content of an app in different forms. The following UI components are presentation views:

-   [List view](#list-view)
-   [Grid view](#grid-view)
-   [Group index](#group-index)

## List View

The list view is used to display multiple items on one screen. It is the most basic view. You can include various UI elements, such as text, icons, images, or buttons, as list items.

To learn how to implement a list view, see [Genlist](../../../native/guides/ui/efl/component-genlist-m.md).

## Progress Components

Progress components provide the user information about ongoing tasks. They are indicators displayed as bars or circles.

There are 2 different types of progress components available:

-   Progress indicator
-   Activity indicator

To learn how to implement progress components, see [Progressbar](../../../native/guides/ui/efl/component-progressbar-m.md).

### Progress Indicator

The progress indicator provides the current status of an ongoing task with a scale. You can use a progress indicator to inform the user of the current status of tasks and include information, such as the estimated time of completion.
