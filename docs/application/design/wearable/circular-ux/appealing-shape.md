# Appealing Shape

The Gear's circular shape means a high degree of freedom when it comes to expressing diverse themes. Placing items along the curved edge can express circulation, or indicate that the items are independent from one another with equal priority. Also consider that the circular shape represents completeness, as any point on its perimeter is the same distance from the center.
