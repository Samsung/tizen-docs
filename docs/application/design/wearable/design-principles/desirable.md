# Desirable

It's not enough to simply make an app that works. Users will only download your app if the aesthetic aspects of your design are desirable, and if the user benefits are clear.

## 1. Concentrate on benefits, not features


Users will decided whether to download your app by asking themselves how it will improve or benefit their lifestyle. Keep this in mind when you're designing your app. Brainstorm a range of user scenarios and be clear on how your app will be beneficial in each situation.

## 2. Design stylish screens


The Gear is a fashion accessory as well as a smart watch. Stylish designs that incorporate typographic and graphical elements for decorative purposes will make your app more attractive.
