# Complications

Complications are any additional features on a watch face that don't show hours and minutes. They allow a watch to do more than just tell time. Complications show key information from an app in an economical way. Users can tap complications to open the corresponding app and see more detailed information. When using complications:

-   **Show data that is relevant to the watch face**

    Effective complications are designed to match the concept of a watch face. For example, you can include complications that show a step count or heart rate if your watch face has a sporty concept.



-   **Keep visual balance between complications**

    If you're providing multiple complications, make sure they are visually balanced on the small circular screen.

### Type


There are 5 types of complication depending on the type of data you want to provide.

-   **Text**

    Text complications only show information with numbers and letters.

-   **Text and icon**

    Text and icon complications indicate information with an icon and show the current data value with text.

-   **Icon**

    Icon complications provide a shortcut link through an icon with no accompanying text.

-   **Gauge**

    Gauge complications show data values as a percentage using a circular progress bar or an icon that changes according to the status of a given value.

-   **Hands**

    Hands complications show the relative level of a data value compared to a whole by using hands.

> **Tip**  
> The Gear Watch Designer helps you design your own complications. You can create your own images or set your complication as a button that opens an app. Visit to the [Gear Watch Designer](http://developer.samsung.com/gear/design/watch-designer) site for more details.



### Layout

Complications should be arranged considering the time display format of a watch face. In analog watch faces, the hour and minute hands keep moving, allowing complications to be placed anywhere on the screen except for the center. Layouts for digital watch faces can vary depending on where the time is displayed.

Another factor to consider is the number of complications you want to include. Design a layout where complications are balanced with all other elements of your watch face.
