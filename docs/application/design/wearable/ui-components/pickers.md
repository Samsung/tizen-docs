# Pickers

Pickers are used to set a single, specific value from a given set.

## Usage

Use pickers to set a number, a date, or time.

## Behavior

-   **Changing value**

    A number picker changes values as the bezel is rotated..

    *Users set a value on a picker by rotating the bezel.*

-   **Selecting pickers**

    You can have multiple pickers on one page at the same time. Pickers on the same page should present values of the same category. A picker is highlighted when users tap it, and changes values as users rotate the bezel.

    *Users can tap to switch between multiple pickers on a page.*

-   **Confirmation**

    A confirmation button at the bottom confirms a set value.

-   **Multiple pages**

    You can distribute pickers across multiple pages if you need to present different kinds of values together. For example, if users need to set both the time and date, have a time picker on one page, and a date picker on the next. The pages are navigated only by swiping. You can provide linear page indicators to show which page is currently being viewed.

-   **Date picker**

    Date pickers set the date, month, and year. Spinning dials present values for each catergory: 12 months, 28/29/30/31 days, and 50 years. One full spin of the year dial is 50 years. Refer to [Date & time](../writing-style.md#date_time) for style guides on displaying the date.

-   **Color picker**

    A color picker allows users to choose a color. Unlike other pickers, itâ€™s displayed as a [rotary selector](rotary-selectors.md). The picker displays the focused color in the center of the screen. When users pick a color, it returns them to the previous screen. You can customize the colors on a picker.
