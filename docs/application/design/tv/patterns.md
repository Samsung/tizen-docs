# Patterns

The Tizen 4.0 TV platform supports common functions and rules in the same way as other applications. These common functions and rules are called patterns.

The following patterns are present on a Tizen 4.0 TV:

-   [App structure](patterns/app-structure.md) on the Tizen 4.0 TV platform consists of layers which are used to display UI components and other items.
-   [Screen layout](patterns/screen-layout.md) defines how the TV screen is divided into 3 parts for help the user achieve desired goals.
-   [Navigation](patterns/navigation.md) is used to change the depth of the view and provide information about the view depth to the user.
-   [Actions](patterns/actions.md) allow the user to edit or change the content and to confirm notifications.
-   [Notifications](patterns/notifications.md) notify the user of new events, such as current states and confirmations.
-   [Recommendations](patterns/recommendations.md) are not strict rules but they should be followed on the Tizen 4.0 TV platform, when possible.
