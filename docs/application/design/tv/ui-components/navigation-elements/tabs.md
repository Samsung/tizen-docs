# Tabs

Tabs are used to categorize content into different groups. The user can switch between the groups by selecting the appropriate tab. Tabs are generally centered below the title bar and arranged horizontally. Each tab can also have an icon.

Tabs can be in either of the following states:

-   Normal
-   Focused
-   Selected
-   Disabled



The following guidelines apply to tabs:

-   1 of the tabs must always be focused or selected.
-   Tab content must be presented in a screen view that provides relevant information.
-   <span>Each tab is equally important and has content at the same level.</span>
