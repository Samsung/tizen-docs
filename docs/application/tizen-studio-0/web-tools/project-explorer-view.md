# Managing Tizen Projects with Project Explorer View

The **Project Explorer** view allows you to view and manage Tizen projects. You can view and change the resources of a project in the view, and build, export, and convert projects through the view.

**Figure: Project Explorer**

In this view, you can:

- Browse the file elements
- Open files in the editor view
- Open projects in a new window
- Create new projects, classes, files, or folders
- Manage existing files (cut, paste, delete, move, or rename files)
- Restore deleted files from local history
- Import or export files and projects

## Opening the Project Explorer View

Usually, the **Project Explorer** view is located in the upper-left side of the Tizen Studio. You can change the position by dragging and dropping it. If you close the view, you can show it again by selecting **Project Explorer** in **Window > Show View > Other > General**.

## Using the Project Explorer View

The files that you select in the **Project Explorer** view affect the information that is displayed in the other views. You can execute and set some operations and configurations by clicking the icons (![Toolbar icons](./media/proj_explorer_op_config.png)) in the toolbar.

**Figure: Executing operations**

![Executing operations](./media/proj_explorer_right_click_w.png)

To execute operations, such as copying, moving, creating new resources, and comparing resources with each other, right-click on any resource in the **Project Explorer** view, and select the desired action in the context menu. The items in the context menu depend on the focused item. Different folder and file types have different action options.
