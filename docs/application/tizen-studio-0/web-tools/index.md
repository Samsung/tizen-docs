# Web Tools

This page explains about various web application development tools supported in Tizen Studio. Tizen Studio IDE provides powerful tool chains to ease web-based app development and provides a platform that is consistent and fast. 

Using Tizen Studio IDE and the web tools, you can create the web app that is:
 - Reliable: Loads instantly
 - Intuitive: Gives seamless and immersive user experience
 - Responsive: Responds quickly to user interactions on any device
 - Discoverable: Found easily through search engines

> Most of the web features discussed in this section are supported in TV Web application development as well. However, TV-specific details are not included in this section. For more information on TV application development tools, see [Samsung Developers Smart TV site](http://developer.samsung.com/tv/develop).

  You can manage various application functionalities and features through the application configuration file, which you can easily configure with a test or form editor. In addition, you can localize your application to use various languages and locale-specific resources by using the **Web Localization** view in Tizen Studio.

  You can debug, profile, and optimize your application with various tools, such as the Dynamic Analyzer, Web Inspector, and JavaScript Analyzer. Tizen Studio provides various views designed to help you identify and fix runtime errors, such as the  **Log** view.

  You can run and test your application using the Tizen Emulator. In addition, the Smart Development Bridge (SDB) tool allows you to communicate with a connected target device, and the unit test tool allows you to create test projects to verify the reliability of your code.

If you prefer a command line interface to the graphical Tizen Studio window, you can use the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](../common-tools/command-line-interface.md) tool during the entire development process.
