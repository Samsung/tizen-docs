# Native Tools

In the Tizen Studio, you can perform all the development activities from the application project creation to testing and packaging.

The Tizen Studio provides various tools to help you with the different native application development process phases:

- [Managing Projects](managing-projects.md)

  You can create new application projects with the Project Wizard, and manage the existing applications in the **Project Explorer** view in the Tizen Studio. You can also manage connected devices, and register certificates for your applications to allow them to be published in the application stores.

- [Writing and Editing Code](coding.md)

  You can use the content assist and API and privilege checker tools to speed up the code writing and verification task. In addition, you can design the application UI by arranging UI components with the visual UI Builder tool, or by defining the components and layout with the EDC script, using the EDC script editor or a graphical Component Designer.

- [Configuring Your Application](configuring.md)

  You can manage various application functionalities and features through the application manifest file, which you can easily configure with the manifest text editor. In addition, you can localize your application to use various languages and locale-specific resources by using the PO file editor and **Resource Manager** view in the Tizen Studio.

- [Debugging Your Application](debugging.md)

  You can debug, profile, and optimize your application with various tools, such as the Dynamic Analyzer, Static Analyzer, Valgrind, and T-trace. The Tizen Studio provides various views designed to help you identify and fix runtime errors, such as the **Log** and **Call Stack** views.

- [Running and Testing Your Application](running-testing.md)

  You can run and test your application using the Tizen emulator. In addition, the Smart Development Bridge (SDB) tool allows you to communicate with a connected target device, and the unit test tool allows you to create test projects to verify the reliability of your code.

If you prefer a command line interface to the graphical Tizen Studio window, you can use the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](../common-tools/command-line-interface.md) tool during the entire development process.
