# Native Tools

This page explains about various native application development tools supported in Tizen Studio. With Tizen Studio IDE, the native app development is simplified, as it supports app development using languages such as C and C++.
In addition, Tizen Studio provides enhanced tools for building the UI, debugging, and for compiling and building the native app code.

Tizen Studio and its native application tools enable you to:
- Maximize the performance of a device to achieve higher throughput for time-sensitive apps, and run computationally intensive applications such as simulations and games.
- Provide access to platform libraries to manage native activities and access physical device components such as sensors, touch input panels, and Wi-Fi.
- Provide enhanced debugging, compilation, and integrated build tools. 

The native application development phases and the tools used in each phase are as follows:

|Development Phases |Description|
|----|:---|
|[Create and manage application](managing-projects.md)|You can create new application projects with Project Wizard tool. You can manage the new application or the existing applications in the **Project Explorer** view. You can manage connected devices, register certificates, and publish your application in the application stores.|
|[Write and Edit Code](coding.md) |You can use the content assist, API and privilege checker tools to speed up the code writing and verification task. You can design the application UI by arranging the UI components with the visual UI Builder tool. You can also design the UI by defining the components and layout with the EDC script, using the EDC script editor or using any other graphical component designer.|
|[Configure](configuring.md) |You can use the manifest file to manage various application functionalities and features. You can easily configure the application functionalities with the manifest text editor. In addition, you can localize your application to use various languages and locale-specific resources by using the PO file editor and **Resource Manager** view in Tizen Studio.|
|[Debug](debugging.md) |You can debug, profile, and optimize your application with various tools, such as the Dynamic Analyzer, Static Analyzer, Valgrind, and T-trace. Tizen Studio provides various views designed to help you identify and fix runtime errors such as **Log** and **Call Stack** views.|
|[Run and Test Your Application](running-testing.md) |You can run and test your application using Tizen emulator. In addition, the Smart Development Bridge (SDB) tool allows you to communicate with a connected target device, and the unit test tool allows you to create test projects to verify the reliability of your code.|
