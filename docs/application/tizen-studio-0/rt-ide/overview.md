# TizenRT

Tizen platform is commercialized on smart TVs, smartphones, wearable devices (Gear S, Gear Fit), and smart home appliances. However, low-end and low-cost IoT devices, such as home appliances without display and wearable bands with a small LCD, have received less attention. The objective of TizenRT is to extend the Tizen platform device coverage to these kind of low-end devices.

TizenRT is an RTOS-based lightweight platform. The following are the hardware and environmental requirements:

- Hardware targets: 

  Cortex-M/R processors with MPU, less than 2 MB RAM, and less than 16 MB Flash.

- Development environment:
	- TizenRT Studio for SmartThings:
	TizenRT Studio version 2.0 (or later) is used as an IDE for developing IoT applications with st_things framework and ARTIK 053(s).
