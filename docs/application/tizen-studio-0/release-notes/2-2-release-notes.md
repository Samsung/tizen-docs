### Known Issues

-   Common
    -   The Java Development Kit (JDK) 9 is not supported.
    -   If you install the Tizen Studio in a directory that requires administrator privileges for access, such as `C:\Program Files`, administrator privileges are required to run the Tizen SDK tools. The Tizen Installer and the Baseline SDK Installer alerts you if you try to install into such a directory.
    
- Web and Native IDE
    -   Since Tizen Studio 2.0, the Connection Explorer has been replaced with the Device Manager, which can cause errors in the Connection Explorer view. You can fix this in two ways:
        -   Reset the perspective on UI - In the Tizen Studio menu, select **Window &gt; Perspective &gt; Reset Perspective**.
        -   Run the command - Update to Tizen Studio version 2.0 and above, run the `eclipse.exe -clean -clearPersistedState` command. Launch the Tizen Studio normally.

    - You can create unit tests for Tizen 2.3.2 and higher version projects only. The Tizen Studio currently does not support unit testing for all earlier versions.
    
- Web IDE
    -   The **Preview** tab in the Web Page Editor sometimes does not appear properly. Use an alternative feature, named Web SDK HTML Editor, which has enhanced features compared to the Web Page Editor. Instead of the **Preview** tab in the Web Page Editor, use the preview (**Ctrl + 4**) feature of the Web SDK HTML Editor.
    -   In RDS mode, the Web unit test result does not update.
    
- Certificate Manager
    -   Overwriting a duplicate certificate profile in the migration wizard works incorrectly on macOS.
    
- Native UI Builder
    -   If the `expanded` attribute in a multibutton entry component is set to `false`, **+** is displayed.
    
- Emulator
    -   To use the Tizen emulator, install an Intel VTx supported by the CPU, and the latest version of the graphic card driver provided by the vendor. Check the prerequisites for the Tizen emulator from [Prerequisites for the Tizen Studio](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-studio/download/installing-tizen-studio/prerequisites#emulator).
        -   If the host machine is using NVIDIA&reg; Optimus&reg; technology on either Ubuntu or Windows&reg;, you must set the Tizen emulator to run with your NVIDIA graphics card. For Ubuntu, check the bumblebee project (<https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee>). For Windows&reg;, select "High Speed NVIDIA Processor" as the "Preferred Graphics processor" in the NVIDIA control panel.
        -   On Ubuntu, if the graphics driver is out-of-date, your Ubuntu desktop session can be occasionally logged out when launching the Emulator Manager, or the emulator skin can be drawn improperly. Check the prerequisites and upgrade to the latest graphics driver.
    -   On Ubuntu 14.04, a shortcut menu can sometimes appear transparent.
    -   On Windows&reg;, depending on your OS theme (such as Non-Aero themes and Windows XP themes), a display surface can be erased for a while if the emulator window is covered with another window. If you click the emulator window, the display surface runs correctly again.
    -   On Windows&reg;, if a "failed to allocate memory" error occurs while executing the emulator, try the following:
        -   Close other programs and try to launch the emulator again.
        -   If the RAM size is set to 768 or 1024 MB for the VM in the Emulator Manager, change it to 512 MB.
        -   Increase the user area of the virtual memory in the system to 3 GB by entering the `bcdedit /set increaseuserva 3072` command on the console with administrator rights (on Windows&reg; 7 only), and reboot.
    -   If you use a MacBook Pro which has both Intel HD and NVIDIA&reg; GPUs, the emulator can be unexpectedly terminated when you execute the emulator with **OpenGL ES Ver** set to **v1.1 & v2.0**. Check the emulator configuration in the Emulator Manager, and on the **General** tab in the **Emulator Configuration** window, set **OpenGL ES Ver** to **v2.0 & v3.0**.
    -   When you launch the Emulator Manager in the Tizen IDE, the Emulator Manager shortcut image is not exposed properly.
    -   Basic Web applications do not install on SD cards.
    
- CLI and SDB
    -   The Tizen Studio does not support the SDB bash auto-completion on Windows&reg; (it is available on Ubuntu and macOS).
    
- Dynamic Analyzer
    -   When analyzing applications on commercial devices running Tizen 3.0, both newly-released or after a firmware update, the following problems exist:
        -   The **Core Frequency** information is not shown.
        -   The **Screenshots on scene transitions** feature is not working.
    -   When analyzing applications on the Tizen 4.0 emulator or reference device, the start-up profiling information is not shown.
    -   The UI Hierarchy viewer feature and start-up profiling are not performed simultaneously.
    -   The Dynamic Analyzer cannot perform Web application profiling with a commercial Tizen device, due to the security policy.
    -   The Dynamic Analyzer cannot show life-cycle information for Web applications.
    -   Widget applications cannot be profiled with the Dynamic Analyzer. They are hidden in the application list on the toolbar for all Tizen platforms, except Tizen 2.3.2.
    
- Web Inspector
    -   According to your Google Chrome&trade; browser version, the Web Inspector console and some other functions do not work properly due to Web core compatibility issues.
