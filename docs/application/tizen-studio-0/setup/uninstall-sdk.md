# Uninstalling Tizen Studio

By uninstalling Tizen Studio, you can completely remove all en platforms and tools that you have installed. To remove a single package or multiple packages, see [Updating Tizen Studio](update-sdk.md).

You can uninstall using the GUI uninstaller or the CLI Package Manager.

## Using the GUI Uninstaller

To uninstallTizen Studio:

1. Launch the Tizen Studio uninstaller.

2. Select the components to uninstall.

   If you do not select the **SDK data** or **KeyStore** components, you can keep the SDK data or keystore files in their directories for future re-use:

   - **SDK data**  
   The SDK data directory typically contains user-created data files, including emulator images, log files, and tool configuration files.

   - **KeyStore**  
   The keystore directory is located inside the SDK data directory, and contains the author and distributor certificate files. If the certificate files are deleted, you cannot restore them from any Tizen seller market site. If you plan to install another Tizen Studio version or reinstall the Tizen Studio later, it is strongly recommended that you back up the certificate files or keep the keystore directory by unchecking the **KeyStore** component.

3. To remove all installed platforms and tools, as well as user-created data and files, click **Uninstall**.

   If you have selected to uninstall the SDK data or KeyStore components, they are also removed.
