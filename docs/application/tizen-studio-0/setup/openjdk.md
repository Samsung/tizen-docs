# OpenJDK 10 and OpenJFX Installation Guide For CLI Installation 

Open Java Development Kit (OpenJDK) is an open source implementation of the Java Standard Edition (Java SE) platform with contribution from Oracle and the open Java community. For more information, see [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/).

Open JavaFX (OpenJFX) is an open source, next generation client application platform for desktop, mobile and embedded systems built on Java. For more information, see [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/).

Before JDK version 9, JavaFX libraries were included in the JDK distribution. Since JDK version 9, JavaFX (JFX) is provided as a separate package.
