# Get Started with Native Applications

When creating your first Tizen native application, you can select from the following options, which all use the C language:

-   [Wearable native application](wearable/first-app.md)

    A wearable application is targeted to run on smart watches, and can be optimized for the smaller screen.

-   [Wearable native watch application](wearable-watch/first-app-watch.md)

    A wearable watch application is a customized watch face that can be shown as the device home screen.

-   [Wearable native widget application](wearable-widget/first-app-widget.md)

    A wearable widget application is a small application that can be shown by specific UI applications (such as the home screen).

-   [Mobile native application](mobile/first-app.md)

    A mobile application is targeted to run on smart phones, and can take advantage of a wide variety of functionalities available on those devices.

The first application examples show a simple application with a basic UI and minimal functionality. Get familiar with the example first, and afterwards you can use it as a basis to build more complex applications with the help of the extensive native API.
