 <p>This widget aims to have more expansive list than the simple list in Elementary that could have more flexible items and allow many more entries while still being fast and low on memory usage. At the same time it was also made to be able to do tree structures. But the price to pay is more complexity when it comes to usage. If all you want is a simple list with icons and a single text, use the normal <a class="el" href="group__Elm__List.html">List</a> object.</p>
<p>Genlist has a fairly large API, mostly because it's relatively complex, trying to be both expansive, powerful and efficient. First we will begin an overview on the theory behind genlist.</p>
<p>This widget inherits from the <a class="el" href="group__Elm__Layout.html">Layout</a> one, so that all the functions acting on it also work for genlist objects.</p>
<p>This widget implements the <b></b>  elm-scrollable-interface interface, so that all (non-deprecated) functions for the base Scroller widget also work for genlists.</p>
<p>Some calls on the genlist's API are marked as <b>deprecated</b>, as they just wrap the scrollable widgets counterpart functions. Use the ones we point you to, for each case of deprecation here, instead -- eventually the deprecated ones will be discarded (next major release).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Genlist_Item_Class"></a>
Genlist item classes - creating items</h2>
<p>In order to have the ability to add and delete items on the fly, genlist implements a class (callback) system where the application provides a structure with information about that type of item (genlist may contain multiple different items with different classes, states and styles). Genlist will call the functions in this struct (methods) when an item is "realized" (i.e., created dynamically, while the user is scrolling the list). All objects will simply be deleted when no longer needed with <a class="el" href="group__Evas__Font__Group.html#ga7e7a625dab7a3890532aa13b43117076">evas_object_del()</a>. The #Elm_Genlist_Item_Class structure contains the following members:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>item_style</code> - This is a constant string and simply defines the name of the item style. It <b>must</b> be specified and the default should be <code>"default"</code>.</li>
<li><code>decorate_item_style</code> - This is a constant string and simply defines the name of the decorate mode item style. It is used to specify decorate mode item style. It can be used when you call elm_genlist_item_decorate_mode_set().</li>
<li><code>decorate_all_item_style</code> - This is a constant string and simply defines the name of the decorate all item style. It is used to specify decorate all item style. It can be used to set selection, checking and deletion mode. This is used when you call elm_genlist_decorate_mode_set().</li>
<li><code>func</code> - A struct with pointers to functions that will be called when an item is going to be actually created. All of them receive a <code>data</code> parameter that will point to the same data passed to <a class="el" href="group__Elm__Genlist.html#ga845c3e247cd8eae4114f98d59f42be2f" title="Append a new item in a given genlist widget.">elm_genlist_item_append()</a> and related item creation functions, and an <code>obj</code> parameter that points to the genlist object itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>The function pointers inside <code>func</code> are <code>text_get</code>, <code>content_get</code>, <code>state_get</code> and <code>del</code>. The 3 first functions also receive a <code>part</code> parameter described below. A brief description of these functions follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>text_get</code> - The <code>part</code> parameter is the name string of one of the existing text parts in the Edje group implementing the item's theme. This function <b>must</b> return a strdup'()ed string, as the caller will free() it when done. See #Elm_Genlist_Item_Text_Get_Cb.</li>
<li><code>content_get</code> - The <code>part</code> parameter is the name string of one of the existing (content) swallow parts in the Edje group implementing the item's theme. It must return <code>NULL</code>, when no content is desired, or a valid object handle, otherwise. The object will be deleted by the genlist on its deletion or when the item is "unrealized". See #Elm_Genlist_Item_Content_Get_Cb.</li>
<li><code>func.state_get</code> - The <code>part</code> parameter is the name string of one of the state parts in the Edje group implementing the item's theme. Return <code>EINA_FALSE</code> for false/off or <code>EINA_TRUE</code> for true/on. Genlists will emit a signal to its theming Edje object with <code>"elm,state,xxx,active"</code> and <code>"elm"</code> as "emission" and "source" arguments, respectively, when the state is true (the default is false), where <code>xxx</code> is the name of the (state) part. See #Elm_Genlist_Item_State_Get_Cb.</li>
<li><code>func.del</code> - This is intended for use when genlist items are deleted, so any data attached to the item (e.g. its data parameter on creation) can be deleted. See #Elm_Genlist_Item_Del_Cb.</li>
</ul>
<p>available item styles:</p>
<ul>
<li>default</li>
<li>default_style - The text part is a textblock</li>
<li>double_label</li>
<li>icon_top_text_bottom</li>
<li>group_index</li>
<li>one_icon - Only 1 icon (left) (since 1.7)</li>
<li>end_icon - Only 1 icon (at end/right) (since 1.7)</li>
<li>no_icon - No icon (at end/right) (since 1.7)</li>
<li>full - Only 1 icon, elm.swallow.content, which consumes whole area of genlist itemj (since 1.7)</li>
</ul>
<p>If one wants to use more icons and texts than are offered in theme, there are two solutions. One is to use 'full' style that has one big swallow part. You can swallow anything there. The other solution is to customize genlist item style in application side by using <a class="el" href="group__Elm__Theme.html#ga71d7575c05248a5c6d7ae3b525e964cc">elm_theme_extension_add()</a> and its own edc. Please refer <a class="el" href="theme_example_01.html">Theme - Using extensions</a> for that.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Genlist_Items"></a>
Structure of items</h2>
<p>An item in a genlist can have 0 or more texts (they can be regular text or textblock Evas objects - that's up to the style to determine), 0 or more contents (which are simply objects swallowed into the genlist item's theming Edje object) and 0 or more <b>boolean states</b>, which have the behavior left to the user to define. The Edje part names for each of these properties will be looked up, in the theme file for the genlist, under the Edje (string) data items named <code>"labels"</code>, <code>"contents"</code> and <code>"states"</code>, respectively. For each of those properties, if more than one part is provided, they must have names listed separated by spaces in the data fields. For the default genlist item theme, we have <b>one</b> text part (<code>"elm.text"</code>), <b>two</b> content parts (<code>"elm.swallow.icon"</code> and <code>"elm.swallow.end"</code>) and <b>no</b> state parts.</p>
<p>A genlist item may be at one of several styles. Elementary provides one by default - "default", but this can be extended by system or application custom themes/overlays/extensions (see <a class="el" href="group__Elm__Theme.html">themes</a> for more details).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Genlist_Manipulation"></a>
Editing and Navigating</h2>
<p>Items can be added by several calls. All of them return a <a class="el" href="group__Elm__General.html#ga13a0c231414b86e62f68afe3c6fb462b">Elm_Object_Item</a> handle that is an internal member inside the genlist. They all take a data parameter that is meant to be used for a handle to the applications internal data (eg. the struct with the original item data). The parent parameter is the parent genlist item this belongs to if it is a tree or an indexed group, and NULL if there is no parent. The flags can be a bitmask of #ELM_GENLIST_ITEM_NONE, #ELM_GENLIST_ITEM_TREE and #ELM_GENLIST_ITEM_GROUP. If #ELM_GENLIST_ITEM_TREE is set then this item is displayed as an item that is able to expand and have child items. If #ELM_GENLIST_ITEM_GROUP is set then this item is group index item that is displayed at the top until the next group comes. The func parameter is a convenience callback that is called when the item is selected and the data parameter will be the func_data parameter, <code>obj</code> be the genlist object and event_info will be the genlist item.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="group__Elm__Genlist.html#ga845c3e247cd8eae4114f98d59f42be2f" title="Append a new item in a given genlist widget.">elm_genlist_item_append()</a> adds an item to the end of the list, or if there is a parent, to the end of all the child items of the parent. <a class="el" href="group__Elm__Genlist.html#gad1cc07925e962db462a82e34e91653ac" title="Prepend a new item in a given genlist widget.">elm_genlist_item_prepend()</a> is the same but adds to the beginning of the list or children list. <a class="el" href="group__Elm__Genlist.html#ga5eba74e22dd1537550bf8b548fa55a41" title="Insert an item before another in a genlist widget.">elm_genlist_item_insert_before()</a> inserts at item before another item and <a class="el" href="group__Elm__Genlist.html#ga35b7c5a1d022c927a589b84ccf969562" title="Insert an item after another in a genlist widget.">elm_genlist_item_insert_after()</a> inserts after the indicated item.</p>
<p>The application can clear the list with <a class="el" href="group__Elm__Genlist.html#gae34f19c00f7da8de682aba1a2669766e" title="Remove all items from a given genlist widget.">elm_genlist_clear()</a> which deletes all the items in the list and elm_object_item_del() will delete a specific item. elm_genlist_item_subitems_clear() will clear all items that are children of the indicated parent item.</p>
<p>To help inspect list items you can jump to the item at the top of the list with <a class="el" href="group__Elm__Genlist.html#gaeacd0a63ec1cbe4c1d21c9350b17cc32" title="Get the first item in the genlist.">elm_genlist_first_item_get()</a> which will return the item pointer, and similarly <a class="el" href="group__Elm__Genlist.html#ga8caa57c4765c7f333ffa69aeefdbb380" title="Get the last item in the genlist.">elm_genlist_last_item_get()</a> gets the item at the end of the list. elm_genlist_item_next_get() and elm_genlist_item_prev_get() get the next and previous items respectively relative to the indicated item. Using these calls you can walk the entire item list/tree. Note that as a tree the items are flattened in the list, so elm_genlist_item_parent_get() will let you know which item is the parent (and thus know how to skip them if wanted).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Genlist_Multi_Selection"></a>
Multi-selection</h2>
<p>If the application wants multiple items to be able to be selected, <a class="el" href="group__Elm__Genlist.html#gaa59068079de22ed91758085dae25367b" title="Enable or disable multi-selection in the genlist.">elm_genlist_multi_select_set()</a> can enable this. If the list is single-selection only (the default), then <a class="el" href="group__Elm__Genlist.html#ga97abf26033fe2041450aa26b6f138c8a" title="Get the selected item in the genlist.">elm_genlist_selected_item_get()</a> will return the selected item, if any, or NULL if none is selected. If the list is multi-select then <a class="el" href="group__Elm__Genlist.html#ga9068ee98b3ec68d0ca056572a5410462" title="Get a list of selected items in the genlist.">elm_genlist_selected_items_get()</a> will return a list (that is only valid as long as no items are modified (added, deleted, selected or unselected)).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Genlist_Usage_Hints"></a>
Usage hints</h2>
<p>There are also convenience functions. elm_object_item_widget_get() will return the genlist object the item belongs to. elm_genlist_item_show() will make the scroller scroll to show that specific item so its visible. <a class="el" href="group__Elm__General.html#ga4465a576c55d197878aeafc0bacf7bb4">elm_object_item_data_get()</a> returns the data pointer set by the item creation functions.</p>
<p>If an item changes (state of boolean changes, text or contents change), then use elm_genlist_item_update() to have genlist update the item with the new state. Genlist will re-realize the item and thus call the functions in the _Elm_Genlist_Item_Class for that item.</p>
<p>To programmatically (un)select an item use elm_genlist_item_selected_set(). To get its selected state use elm_genlist_item_selected_get(). Similarly to expand/contract an item and get its expanded state, use elm_genlist_item_expanded_set() and elm_genlist_item_expanded_get(). And again to make an item disabled (unable to be selected and appear differently) use elm_object_item_disabled_set() to set this and elm_object_item_disabled_get() to get the disabled state.</p>
<p>In general to indicate how the genlist should expand items horizontally to fill the list area, use <a class="el" href="group__Elm__Genlist.html#ga7749546e6666dd50ab7d1b8a4dbb99ad" title="This sets the horizontal stretching mode.">elm_genlist_mode_set()</a>. Valid modes are ELM_LIST_LIMIT, ELM_LIST_COMPRESS and ELM_LIST_SCROLL. The default is ELM_LIST_SCROLL. This mode means that if items are too wide to fit, the scroller will scroll horizontally. Otherwise items are expanded to fill the width of the viewport of the scroller. If it is ELM_LIST_LIMIT, items will be expanded to the viewport width if larger than the item, but genlist widget witdh is limited to the largest item. Do not use ELM_LIST_LIMIT mode with homogeneous mode turned on. ELM_LIST_COMPRESS can be combined with a different style that uses edjes' ellipsis feature (cutting text off like this: "tex...").</p>
<p>Items will call their selection func and callback only once when first becoming selected. Any further clicks will do nothing, unless you enable always select with <a class="el" href="group__Elm__Genlist.html#gaf037c92717b93ea122ae26c757a23c65" title="Set the genlist select mode.">elm_genlist_select_mode_set()</a> as ELM_OBJECT_SELECT_MODE_ALWAYS. This means even if selected, every click will make the selected callbacks be called. <a class="el" href="group__Elm__Genlist.html#gaf037c92717b93ea122ae26c757a23c65" title="Set the genlist select mode.">elm_genlist_select_mode_set()</a> as ELM_OBJECT_SELECT_MODE_NONE will turn off the ability to select items entirely and they will neither appear selected nor call selected callback functions.</p>
<p>Remember that you can create new styles and add your own theme augmentation per application with <a class="el" href="group__Elm__Theme.html#ga71d7575c05248a5c6d7ae3b525e964cc">elm_theme_extension_add()</a>. If you absolutely must have a specific style that overrides any theme the user or system sets up you can use <a class="el" href="group__Elm__Theme.html#ga6c9e97741f3893e14508ec5e4410b4f0">elm_theme_overlay_add()</a> to add such a file.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Genlist_Implementation"></a>
Implementation</h2>
<p>Evas tracks every object you create. Every time it processes an event (mouse move, down, up etc.) it needs to walk through objects and find out what event that affects. Even worse every time it renders display updates, in order to just calculate what to re-draw, it needs to walk through many many many objects. Thus, the more objects you keep active, the more overhead Evas has in just doing its work. It is advisable to keep your active objects to the minimum working set you need. Also remember that object creation and deletion carries an overhead, so there is a middle-ground, which is not easily determined. But don't keep massive lists of objects you can't see or use. Genlist does this with list objects. It creates and destroys them dynamically as you scroll around. It groups them into blocks so it can determine the visibility etc. of a whole block at once as opposed to having to walk the whole list. This 2-level list allows for very large numbers of items to be in the list (tests have used up to 2,000,000 items). Also genlist employs a queue for adding items. As items may be different sizes, every item added needs to be calculated as to its size and thus this presents a lot of overhead on populating the list, this genlist employs a queue. Any item added is queued and spooled off over time, actually appearing some time later, so if your list has many members you may find it takes a while for them to all appear, with your process consuming a lot of CPU while it is busy spooling.</p>
<p>Genlist also implements a tree structure for items, but it does so with callbacks to the application, with the application filling in tree structures when requested (allowing for efficient building of a very deep tree that could even be used for file-management). See the above smart signal callbacks for details.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Genlist_Smart_Events"></a>
Genlist smart events</h2>
<p>This widget emits the following signals, besides the ones sent from Elm_Layout:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"activated"</code> - The user has double-clicked or pressed (enter|return|spacebar) on an item. The <code>event_info</code> parameter is the item that was activated.</li>
<li><code>"pressed"</code> - The user pressed an item. The <code>event_info</code> parameter is the item that was pressed.</li>
<li><code>"released"</code> - The user released an item. The <code>event_info</code> parameter is the item that was released.</li>
<li><code>"clicked,double"</code> - The user has double-clicked an item. The <code>event_info</code> parameter is the item that was double-clicked.</li>
<li><code>"clicked,right"</code> - The user has right-clicked an item. The <code>event_info</code> parameter is the item that was right-clicked. (since 1.13)</li>
<li><code>"selected"</code> - This is called when a user has made an item selected. The event_info parameter is the genlist item that was selected.</li>
<li><code>"unselected"</code> - This is called when a user has made an item unselected. The event_info parameter is the genlist item that was unselected.</li>
<li><code>"expanded"</code> - This is called when elm_genlist_item_expanded_set() is called and the item is now meant to be expanded. The event_info parameter is the genlist item that was indicated to expand. It is the job of this callback to then fill in the child items.</li>
<li><code>"contracted"</code> - This is called when elm_genlist_item_expanded_set() is called and the item is now meant to be contracted. The event_info parameter is the genlist item that was indicated to contract. It is the job of this callback to then delete the child items.</li>
<li><code>"expand,request"</code> - This is called when a user has indicated they want to expand a tree branch item. The callback should decide if the item can expand (has any children) and then call elm_genlist_item_expanded_set() appropriately to set the state. The event_info parameter is the genlist item that was indicated to expand.</li>
<li><code>"contract,request"</code> - This is called when a user has indicated they want to contract a tree branch item. The callback should decide if the item can contract (has any children) and then call elm_genlist_item_expanded_set() appropriately to set the state. The event_info parameter is the genlist item that was indicated to contract.</li>
<li><code>"realized"</code> - This is called when the item in the list is created as a real evas object. event_info parameter is the genlist item that was created.</li>
<li><code>"unrealized"</code> - This is called just before an item is unrealized. After this call content objects provided will be deleted and the item object itself delete or be put into a floating cache.</li>
<li><code>"drag,start,up"</code> - This is called when the item in the list has been dragged (not scrolled) up.</li>
<li><code>"drag,start,down"</code> - This is called when the item in the list has been dragged (not scrolled) down.</li>
<li><code>"drag,start,left"</code> - This is called when the item in the list has been dragged (not scrolled) left.</li>
<li><code>"drag,start,right"</code> - This is called when the item in the list has been dragged (not scrolled) right.</li>
<li><code>"drag,stop"</code> - This is called when the item in the list has stopped being dragged.</li>
<li><code>"drag"</code> - This is called when the item in the list is being dragged.</li>

<li><code>"multi,pinch,out"</code> - This is called when the genlist is multi-touch pinched out.</li>
<li><code>"multi,pinch,in"</code> - This is called when the genlist is multi-touch pinched in.</li>
<li><code>"swipe"</code> - This is called when the genlist is swiped.</li>
<li><code>"moved"</code> - This is called when a genlist item is moved by a user interaction in a reorder mode. The <code>event_info</code> parameter is the item that was moved.</li>
<li><code>"moved,after"</code> - This is called when a genlist item is moved after another item in reorder mode. The event_info parameter is the reordered item. To get the relative previous item, use elm_genlist_item_prev_get(). This signal is called along with "moved" signal.</li>
<li><code>"moved,before"</code> - This is called when a genlist item is moved before another item in reorder mode. The event_info parameter is the reordered item. To get the relative previous item, use elm_genlist_item_next_get(). This signal is called along with "moved" signal.</li>
<li><code>"index,update"</code> - This is called when a genlist item index is changed. Note that this callback is called while each item is being realized.</li>
<li><code>"language,changed"</code> - This is called when the program's language is changed. Call the <a class="el" href="group__Elm__Genlist.html#ga2a5a48241e3fc59c0ee75fc85a014df7" title="Update the contents of all realized items.">elm_genlist_realized_items_update()</a> if items text should be translated.</li>
<li><code>"tree,effect,finished"</code> - This is called when a genlist tree effect is finished.</li>
<li><code>"highlighted"</code> - an item in the list is highlighted. This is called when the user presses an item or keyboard selection is done so the item is physically highlighted. The <code>event_info</code> parameter is the item that was highlighted.</li>
<li><code>"unhighlighted"</code> - an item in the list is unhighlighted. This is called when the user releases an item or keyboard selection is moved so the item is physically unhighlighted. The <code>event_info</code> parameter is the item that was unhighlighted.</li>
<li><code>"focused"</code> - When the genlist has received focus. (since 1.8)</li>
<li><code>"unfocused"</code> - When the genlist has lost focus. (since 1.8)</li>
<li><code>"item,focused"</code> - When the genlist item has received focus. (since 1.10)</li>

<p>Enable/disable homogeneous mode. </p>
<p>This will enable the homogeneous mode where items are of the same height and width so that genlist may do the lazy-loading at its maximum (which increases the performance for scrolling the list). In the normal mode, genlist will pre-calculate all the items' sizes even though they are not in use. So items' callbacks are called many times than expected. But homogeneous mode will skip the item size pre-calculation process so items' callbacks are called only when the item is needed.</p>
