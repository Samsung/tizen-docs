<div class="textblock"><p>This feature is not supported on Tizen.</p>
<p>This example shows how to use an Ecore_Con_Url and enable it to receive/send cookies. These cookies can be set by the server, saved to a file, loaded later from this file and sent again to the server. The complete example can be found at <a class="el" href="ecore_con_url_cookies_example_8c-example.html">ecore_con_url_cookies_example.c</a></p>
<p>First we are setting some callbacks for events that will be sent when data arrives in our connection (the data is the content of the file being downloaded), and when the download is completed. The <code>_url_data_cb</code> and <code>_url_complete_cb</code> are these callbacks:</p>
 <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"></pre></div></p>
<p>In the <code>main</code> function we parse some parameter from the command line. These parameters are the url that we are connecting to, and cookie use policy.</p>
<p>After that we initialize the libraries and create a handler to our request using the given url:</p>
<p><div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"></pre></div></p>
<p>We also set the event handlers for this request and add a header to it, that will inform our custom user agent:</p>
<p><div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"></pre></div></p>
<p>Now we start playing with cookies. First, let's call Url Cookies Initiation fucntion to inform that we want cookies enabled. We also set a file from which we are loading previously set (old) cookies, in case that we don't want to clear old cookies or old session cookies.</p>
<p>After that we set the file where we are going to save all valid cookies in the Ecore_Con_Url object. This includes previously loaded cookies (that weren't cleared) and new cookies set by the response header "Set-Cookie" that comes with the response to our request:</p>
<p><div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"></pre></div></p>
<p>And finally, before performing the request, we check the command passed as argument in the command line and use it to choose between clearing old cookies, clearing just old session cookies, or ignoring old session cookies.</p>
<p>After that we just finish our code as expected:</p>
<p><div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"></pre></div></p>
<p>Notice that in this code, if we want to clear old cookies, we also don't load them from the file. This is a bit confusing and the API isn't clear, but Url Cookies File Add function will load cookies from the specified files just when the operation is really performed (i.e. Url Get function is called). So if Url Cookies Clear function is called before Url Get function, the old cookies may not have been loaded yet, so they are not cleared. To avoid having old cookies loaded, don't add any cookie file with Url Cookies File Add function.</p>
<p>The Url Cookies Clear function is just useful to clear cookies that are already loaded/valid in the Ecore_Con_Url object (from a previous request, for example). </p>
