<div class="textblock"><p>In this example, we add two images to a canvas, each one having a quarter of the canvas' size, positioned on the top left and bottom right corners, respectively: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"></pre></div> See there is a border image around the top left one, <b>which is the one that should be displayed</b>. The other one will (on purpose) fail to load, because we set a wrong file path as image source on it:  <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"></pre></div> This is how one is supposed to test for success when binding source images to image objects: <a class="el" href="group__Evas__Object__Image.html#ga1e0b4bbce618e520c2477562b6af7825" title="Retrieves a number representing any error that occurred during the last loading of the given image ob...">evas_object_image_load_error_get()</a>, followed by <a class="el" href="group__Evas__Utils.html#gaca3384642e5ebb32cfeab24c760c739a" title="Converts the given Evas image load error code into a string describing it in english.">evas_load_error_str()</a>, if one wants to pretty print/log the error. We'll talk about the border image further.</p>
<p>To interact with the program, there's a command line interface. A help string can be asked for with the 'h' key:  <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"></pre></div> The first four commands will change the top left images's <b>fill</b> property values, which dictate how the source image (Enlightenment's logo) is to be displayed through the image object's area. Experiment with those switches until you get the idea of evas_object_fill_set().</p>
<p>The 'f' command will toggle that image's "filled" property, which is whether it should track its size and set the fill one to fit the object's boundaries perfectly (stretching). Note that this command and the four above it will conflict: in real usage one would use one or other ways of setting an image object's viewport with regard to its image source.</p>
<p>There are four commands which deal with the border image. This red frame is there to illustrate <b>image borders</b>. The image source for the border is a solid red rectangle, with a transparent <b>rectangular</b> area in its middle. See how we use it to get a 3 pixel wide frame with <code>evas_object_image_border_set(d.border, 3, 3, 3, 3)</code>. To finish the effect of showing it as a border, we issue <code>evas_object_image_border_center_fill_set(d.border, EVAS_BORDER_FILL_NONE)</code>.</p>
<p>Use 't' to change the border's thickness. 'b' will change the border image's center region rendering schema: either a hole (no rendering), blending (see the original transparent area, in this case) or solid (the transparent area gets filled). Finally, 'c' will change the border's scaling factor.</p>
<p>While you have the border in 'blending mode', test the command 'm': it will set whether to use or not smooth scaling on the border's source image. Since the image is small originally (30 x 30), we're obviously up-scaling it (except the border pixels, do you remember?). With this last switch, you'll either see the transparent shape in the middle flat (no smoothing) or blurry (smoothed).</p>
<p>The full example follows.</p>
