<div class="textblock"><p>This code places two Elementary file selector widgets on a window. The one on the left is layouting file system items in a <b>list</b>, while the the other is layouting them in a <b>grid</b>.</p>
<p>The one having the majority of hooks of interest is on the left, which we create as follows:  <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"></pre></div></p>
<p>Note that we enable custom edition of file/directory selection, via the text entry it has on its bottom, via elm_fileselector_is_save_set(). It starts with the list view, which is the default, and we make it not expandable in place (elm_fileselector_expandable_set()), so that it replaces its view's contents with the current directory's entries each time one navigates to a different folder. For both of file selectors we are starting to list the contents found in the <code>"/tmp"</code> directory (elm_fileselector_path_set()).</p>
<p>Note the code setting it to "grid mode" and observe the differences in the file selector's views, in the example. We also hide the second file selector's Ok/Cancel buttons -- since it's there just to show the grid view (and navigation) -- via elm_fileselector_buttons_ok_cancel_set().</p>
<p>The <code>"done"</code> event, which triggers the callback below  <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"></pre></div> will be called at the time one clicks the "Ok"/"Cancel" buttons of the file selector (on the left). Note that it will print the path to the current selection, if any.</p>
<p>The <code>"selected"</code> event, which triggers the callback below  <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"></pre></div> takes place when one selects a file (if the file selector is <b>not</b> under folders-only mode) or when one selects a folder (when in folders-only mode). Experiment it by selecting different file system entries.</p>
<p>What comes next is the code creating the three check boxes and two buttons below the file selector in the right. They will exercise a bunch of functions on the file selector's API, for the instance on the left. Experiment with them, specially the buttons, to get the difference between elm_fileselector_path_get() and elm_fileselector_selected_get().</p>
<p>Finally, there's the code adding the second file selector, on the right:  <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"></pre></div></p>
<p>Pay attention to the code setting it to "grid mode" and observe the differences in the file selector's views, in the example. We also hide the second file selector's Ok/Cancel buttons -- since it's there just to show the grid view (and navigation) -- via elm_fileselector_buttons_ok_cancel_set().</p>
