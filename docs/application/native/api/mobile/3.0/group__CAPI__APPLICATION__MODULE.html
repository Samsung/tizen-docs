<p>The <a class="el" href="group__CAPI__APPLICATION__MODULE.html">Application</a> API provides functions to manage the main event loop, the application's state change events, basic system events, and get information about the application. </p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="CAPI_APPLICATION_MODULE_OVERVIEW"></a>
Overview</h2>
<p>The Application API handles an application state change or system events and provides mechanisms that launch other applications. The Tizen native application is similar to a conventional Linux application, but has some additional features optimized for mobile devices, which may have constraints such as relatively small screen sizes and lack of system resources compared to a larger system. For example, for power management reasons, the application may wish to take actions to reduce usage when it finds out that it had its display window covered over by another application's window. State change events are delivered so that this is possible. The Application API provides interfaces for the following three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting or exiting the main event loop (mandatory for every Tizen native application)</li>
<li>Registering callbacks for application state change events</li>
<li>Registering callbacks for basic system events</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="CAPI_APPLICATION_MODULE_EVENT_LOOP"></a>
Event Loop</h3>
<p>For an application to operate successfully, it must receive events from the platform. For this, it needs to start the main event loop - this is mandatory for all Tizen native applications. The <a class="el" href="group__CAPI__APPLICATION__MODULE.html#gab3ca636fb2b41d55b461f85cf205614d" title="Runs the application&#39;s main loop until ui_app_exit() is called.">ui_app_main()</a> function is used to start the event loop. Before calling this function, you should set up the <a class="el" href="structui__app__lifecycle__callback__s.html" title="The structure type containing the set of callback functions for handling application lifecycle events...">ui_app_lifecycle_callback_s</a> structure, which is passed to the function (see the following sections).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="CAPI_APPLICATION_MODULE_STATE_CHANGE_EVENT"></a>

<p>The application state change events include the following: </p>

<h3><a class="anchor" id="CAPI_APPLICATION_MODULE_STATES_TRANSITIONS"></a>
The Application States and Transitions</h3>
<p>The Tizen native application can be in one of the several different states. Typically, the application is launched by the user from the Launcher, or by another application. As the application is starting, <a class="el" href="group__CAPI__APPLICATION__MODULE.html#ga0a37776fde2feb7fe37f52d9d89b513c" title="Called when the application starts.">app_create_cb()</a> is executed, and then the main event loop starts. After executing event loop, <a class="el" href="group__CAPI__APPLICATION__MODULE.html#gaa840bad6da48beb7f271564f9c77019e" title="Called when another application sends a launch request to the application.">app_control_cb()</a> and <a class="el" href="group__CAPI__APPLICATION__MODULE.html#ga0895f6a8d8bafd08223a573a905a776d" title="Called when the application becomes visible.">app_resume_cb()</a> will be invoked. The application now normally becomes the front-most window with focus. When the application loses the front-most/focus status, the <a class="el" href="group__CAPI__APPLICATION__MODULE.html#ga933b31419d80d54033a8cba64eb7804f" title="Called when the application is completely obscured by another application and becomes invisible...">app_pause_cb()</a> callback is invoked. There are many scenarios for your application to go into the pause state, which means your application is not terminated, but is running in the background:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new application is launched from the request of your application</li>
<li>The user requests to go to the home screen</li>
<li>A system event occurs and it causes a resident application with higher priority (e.g. a phone call is received) to become active, and hides your application temporarily</li>
<li>An alarm went off for another application so it now becomes the top-most window and hides your application</li>
</ul>
<p>Since Tizen 2.4, the application on the background goes in to a suspended state. In the suspended state, the application process is executed with limited CPU resources. In other words, the platform does not allow the running of the background applications. When your application becomes visible again, the <a class="el" href="group__CAPI__APPLICATION__MODULE.html#ga0895f6a8d8bafd08223a573a905a776d" title="Called when the application becomes visible.">app_resume_cb()</a> callback is invoked. Some possible scenarios for your application to become visible are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Another application requests your application to run (perhaps the Task Navigator which shows all running applications and lets the user select any app to run)</li>
<li>All applications on top of your application in the window stack finish</li>
<li>An alarm is going off for your application so it becomes the top-most window and hides other applications When your application starts exiting, the <a class="el" href="group__CAPI__APPLICATION__MODULE.html#ga933b31419d80d54033a8cba64eb7804f" title="Called when the application is completely obscured by another application and becomes invisible...">app_pause_cb()</a> callback is invoked if the application is visible, and then the <a class="el" href="group__CAPI__APPLICATION__MODULE.html#ga3f00a008e3612d97f68042635203d792" title="Called when the application&#39;s main loop exits.">app_terminate_cb()</a> callback is invoked. Possible scenarios to start termination of your application are:</li>
<li>Your application itself requests to exit by calling <a class="el" href="group__CAPI__APPLICATION__MODULE.html#ga23a33367187a8f387f65044fc920e762" title="Exits the main loop of application.">ui_app_exit()</a> to terminate the event loop</li>
<li>The Low Memory Killer is killing your application in a low memory situation. Note that a service application doesn't have UI, so the service application doesn't have Paused state. Application state changes are managed by the underlying framework. Refer to the following state diagram to see the possible transitions:</li>

<p>The Application API defines five states with their corresponding transition handlers. The state transition is notified through the state transition callback function, whether the application is created, is running, is paused, is resumed, or is terminated. And the application has to perform a specific task that is appropriate to those state changes.</p>

 <h3><a class="anchor" id="CAPI_APPLICATION_MODULE_HOW_TO_START"></a>
How to start the Tizen native application</h3>
<p>An application can be launched by the user from the Launcher or by another application. Regardless of how an application is launched, the Application Framework starts an application by creating a new process and calls the entry point of the application. Like a conventional Linux application, the main function of its application is the entry point. In the Tizen application, the main task is to hand over control to the Application Framework by calling the <a class="el" href="group__CAPI__APPLICATION__MODULE.html#gab3ca636fb2b41d55b461f85cf205614d" title="Runs the application&#39;s main loop until ui_app_exit() is called.">ui_app_main()</a> function.</p>

<p>Called when another application sends a launch request to the application. </p>
<p>When the application is launched, this callback function is called after the main loop of the application starts up. The passed app_control handle describes the launch request and contains the information about why the application is launched. If the launch request is sent to the application in the running or pause state, this callback function can be called again to notify that the application has been asked to launch. The application could be explicitly launched by the user from the application launcher or be launched to perform the specific operation by another application. The application is responsible for handling each launch request and responding appropriately. Using the App Control API, the application can get information about what is to be performed.
