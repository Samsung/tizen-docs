# Receiving Content from Other Applications

The basic tasks involved in receiving content from other applications
are advertising the features available in your application, handling the
incoming content, and managing any extra data sent with the content. The
following sections provide you with the fundamental building blocks for
receiving content that other applications want to share with you.

## Exporting Application Control Functionality

To allow other applications to find and use your application features
implicitly without your application ID, you must advertise your
application features to other applications. You can do this by declaring
your application control information in the `tizen-manifest.xml` file.

The following example shows an advertisement for the `VIEW` and `CALL`
application control operations:

```xml
<app-control>
   <mime name = "application/xhtml+xml"/>
   <operation name = "http://tizen.org/appcontrol/operation/view"/>
   <uri name = "http"/>
</app-control>
<app-control>
   <operation name = "http://tizen.org/appcontrol/operation/dial"/>
   <uri name = "tel"/>
</app-control>
```

> **Note**  
> In the application manifest file, the valid operation name
format is `http://tizen.org/appcontrol/operation/<verb>`. You cannot use the related macro name format: `APP_CONTROL_OPERATION_<VERB>`.



## Handling Incoming Content

application, the application framework calls your application's
`app_control_cb()` callback just after your application enters the main
loop. This callback is passed to the handler, `app_control`, containing
the reason why your application was launched. For example, your
application can be launched to open a file that another application is
sharing with you.

When an application control request arrives, your application is
responsible for checking and responding to the `app_control` handler
accordingly.

The following example shows how you can initialize the application to
allow the application control callback to handle the request for the
`APP_CONTROL_OPERATION_VIEW` operation:

```c++
int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    struct appdata ad;

    ui_app_lifecycle_callback_s event_callback;

    event_callback.create = app_create;
    event_callback.terminate = app_terminate;
    event_callback.pause = app_pause;
    event_callback.resume = app_resume;
    /* Register the app control callback */
    event_callback.app_control = app_control;

    memset(&ad, 0x0, sizeof(struct appdata));

    return ui_app_main(argc, argv, &event_callback, &ad);
}

/* App control callback */
static void
app_control(app_control_h app_control, void *user_data)
{
    struct appdata *ad = (struct appdata *)user_data;
    char *operation;
    char *uri;
    char *mime_type;

    app_control_get_operation(app_control, operation);

    if (!strcmp(operation, APP_CONTROL_OPERATION_VIEW)) {
        app_control_get_uri(app_control, &uri);
        app_control_get_mime(app_control, &mime_type);

        if (uri && !strcmp(mime_type, "image/jpg"))
                /* Display the image file the other application is sharing with you */
                display_image_file(ad, uri);
    }

    if (ad->win)
        elm_win_activate(ad->win);
}
```

## Managing Extra Data

Using the `app_control_foreach_extra_data()` function, you can read any
extra data added to the `app_control` handle. This function calls the
`_app_control_extra_data_cb()` callback once for each extra data
key-value pair contained in the handle. When the callback returns
`false`, the iteration ends.

```c++
bool
_app_control_extra_data_cb(app_control_h app, const char *key, void *user_data)
{
    int ret;
    char *value;

    ret = app_control_get_extra_data(app, key, &value);
    if (ret == APP_CONTROL_ERROR_NONE)
        dlog_print(DLOG_DEBUG, LOG_TAG, "[value] %s", value);
    else
        dlog_print(DLOG_ERROR, LOG_TAG, "app_control_get_extra_data() failed. err = %d", ret);

    return true;
}

ret = app_control_foreach_extra_data(app, _app_control_extra_data_cb, 0);
if (ret != APP_CONTROL_ERROR_NONE)
    dlog_print(DLOG_ERROR, LOG_TAG, "app_control_foreach_extra_data() failed. err = %d", ret);
```
