# Understanding Tizen Programming

When designing Tizen native applications, you need to take into account the following programming concepts:

- [Application Filtering](app-filtering.md)
- [Security and API Privileges](sec-privileges.md)
- [Security and API Privileges for Apps with API Version 4.0 or Earlier](old-versioned-sec-privileges.md)
- [Event Handling](event-handling.md)
- [Error Handling](error-handling.md)
- [File System Directory Hierarchy](io-overview.md)
- [Application Signing and Certificates](sign-certificate.md)
- [API Versioning and Deprecation Policy of the Tizen Platform](deprecation-policy.md)
- [Removed functions and enumerations of Tizen Native API](native-removed-history.md)
