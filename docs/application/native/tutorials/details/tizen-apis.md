# Tizen APIs


You can develop native applications using the native API modules. You
can create diverse applications with a variety of features, and design
versatile applications and intriguing user interfaces with text and
graphics while taking advantage of many device functionalities, such as
sensors and call operations. In addition, you can, for example, manage
content and media files, use network and social services, and provide
messaging and embedded Web browsing functionality.

The Tizen platform also provides a special kind of native application
model, which consists of 1 UI native application and 1 or more native
service applications.

The native API specification consists of multiple API modules that
represent the versatility and wide variety of features that you can
implement in your native application. Each API module represents a set
of logically similar submodule APIs which can be grouped into the same
category. This structure was designed to make it easier for you to
narrow down and find the specific methods that you require to implement
a feature in your native application.

There are 2 types of submodules - Tizen native modules and open source
modules. The integration of open source modules in the native API
structure allows you to add additional features by using well-known open
source libraries. This is particularly advantageous for developers who
are familiar with certain libraries because they can quickly add
features and use previously written code in certain cases.

The following table defines the Tizen mobile native API layout. The
table describes the API modules and the functionality of all their
submodule APIs within that module. The table also acts as a reference
source for when you are planning a new feature for your application and
need a way to efficiently compare different API modules to decide which
APIs to use.

> **Note**  
> Except as noted, the mobile native APIs are available since Tizen 2.3.

The following table describes the API modules in the wearable profile
and the functionality of all their submodule APIs within that module.
The table also acts as reference sources for when you are planning a new
feature for your application and need a way to efficiently compare
different API modules to decide which APIs to use.

> **Note**  
> Except as noted, the wearable native APIs are available since Tizen 2.3.1.
