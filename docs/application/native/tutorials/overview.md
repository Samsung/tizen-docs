# Introduction to Native applications

The introduction to native applications documentation provides overall information you need to become familiar with native-specific Tizen programming and the Tizen application model:

- [Application Development Process](process/app-dev-process.md)

  Teaches you how to create a Tizen application from the initial application planning stage to the end stages where you are ready to run and package your application.

- [Understanding Tizen Programming](details/details.md)

  Introduces the Tizen platform, its architecture, and some useful programming concepts you need to take into account when designing Tizen applications.

- [Overview of Tizen UI Development](ui-builder/ui-builder-overview.md)

  Describes the basic characteristics and components of UI development with EFL.

- [Designing Your Native Application](ui-builder/ui-builder-app-design.md)

  Teaches you how to develop a native application using the native UI Builder tool.

- [Creating Applications with Connectivity and Network](feature/app-connectivity.md)

  Demonstrates how you can create applications with connectivity to access various networks to use data services, or connect to other devices.

- [Creating Applications with Contacts](feature/app-contacts.md)

  Demonstrates how you can create applications that handle various people-related information, such as contacts, groups, accounts, and address books.

- [Creating Applications with Content Sharing](feature/app-contentshare.md)

  Demonstrates how you can create applications with content sharing through application control features or simple NDEF message transfer.

- [Creating Applications with Graphics and Animation](feature/app-graphics.md)

  Demonstrates how you can create applications with graphics and animation to draw various shapes, such as squares and polygons, on the screen and animate screen elements to change their size, position, and color.

- [Creating Applications with Multimedia](feature/app-multimedia.md)

  Demonstrates how you can create applications with multimedia to play and record audio and video, and use the device camera to take photos.

- [Creating Applications with Sensors](feature/app-sensor.md)

  Demonstrates how you can create applications with the accelerator and proximity sensors to monitor user gestures and motions, such as phone tilting and accidental touch screen taps when held to the ear during a call.

- [Best Practices for Location](feature/best-practice-battery.md)

  Demonstrates best practices for reducing battery drain and saving battery life when you use the location service.
