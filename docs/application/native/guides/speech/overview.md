# Speech and Voice


The speech and voice features introduce how you can convert speech to text and back to speech, and manage voice commands.


You can use the following speech and voice features in your native applications:

- [Speech-to-text](stt.md)

  You can recognize sound data recorded by the user and send the result as text. The result text can, for example, be displayed on the screen.

- [Text-to-speech](tts.md)

  You can synthesize text into sound data as utterances and play it. You can also control the playback by pausing, resuming, and stopping it, as needed.

- [Voice Control](voice-control.md)

  You can allow the user to control the device through voice commands. You can register voice commands, which trigger a callback when the user speaks them. Voice commands registered for EFL-supported UI components can be used to perform component-related actions, such as button clicks.

- [Voice Control Engine](voice-control-engine.md)

  You can manage Voice-Control-Engine (VCE) service application and control the recorded audio. The result of audio recording is sent as a predefined command.
