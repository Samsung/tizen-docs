# Machine-Learining


Machine-learning features introduce how you can handle machine learning frameworks, like tensorflow, tensorflow-lite, with the construction of data pipeline.

You can use the following machine-learning features in your native applications:

- [Machine Learning Inference C-API](machine-learning-inference.md)

  You can construct the data pipeline which contains the machine learning model filter. The pipeline can be assembled and controlled with various elements of [gstreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/).
