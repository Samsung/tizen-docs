# Machine Learning


Machine learning features help you to handle machine learning frameworks, like TensorFlow and TensorFlow-Lite, with the construction of data pipeline.

You can use the following machine learning features in your native applications:

- [Machine Learning Inference](machine-learning-inference.md)

  You can create data pipelines that contain the machine learning model filters. The pipeline can be assembled and controlled with various elements of [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/).

- [Machine Learning Training](machine-learning-training.md)

  You can construct, control, and train a machine learning model on-the-fly. The training can be done using the code or with a set of format that describes the model. These models can be trained on the device locally when needed.
