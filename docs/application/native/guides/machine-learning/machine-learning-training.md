# Machine Learning Training

Machine Learning Training API allows you to construct, control, and train a machine learning model in Tizen devices.

The main features of the Machine Learning Training API include:

- Constructing deep neural network (DNN)
   - You can construct a DNN model using a model description file or by writing code through Machine Learning Training API.
- Training with your own data
   - Machine Learning Training API also allows you to train the model with your own data as a File I/O or by defining a data generator.
- Evaluating the model during training
   - You can validate and test your model during the training process easily by defining the dataset.

> [!NOTE]
> Every example code does not handle all error use cases.
> Error must be handled more extensively compared to the example code written in this page.

## Prerequisites

To enable your application to use Machine Learning Training API:

1. To use the functions and data types of the Machine Learning Inference API, include the `<nntrainer.h>` header file in your application:

   ```c
   #include <nntrainer.h>
   ```

2. To use the Machine Learning Training API, include the following features in your `tizen-manifest.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <feature name="http://tizen.org/feature/machine_learning">true</feature>
   <feature name="http://tizen.org/feature/machine_learning.training">true</feature>
   ```

In case of saving or loading model files from the outside of the application's own resources, the application has to request permission by adding the following privileges to the `tizen-manifest.xml` file:

```xml
<privileges>
  <!-- For accessing media storage -->
  <privilege>http://tizen.org/privilege/mediastorage</privilege>
  <!-- For accessing external storage -->
  <privilege>http://tizen.org/privilege/externalstorage</privilege>
</privileges>
```

## Building blocks

Following are the four major components of Machine Learning Training API:

 - [Model](#model)
 - [Layer](#layer)
 - [Optimizer](#optimizer)
 - [Dataset](#dataset)

### Model


Model is a wrapper component that has the topology of layers, optimizers, and datasets.
The model performs training and saves the updated parameters that can later be used for inference.
In the following figure, `data` represents input data or feature and `label` is the actual value to be tested over prediction:

![model](./media/model.png)

Currently, only a sequential neural network is supported:

```c
// Create model
ml_train_model_h model;
ml_train_model_construct(&model);

/* Configure model(omitted for brevity) */

// Compile model. This freezes model and afterwards the model cannot be modified.
ml_train_model_compile(model, "loss=cross", "batch_size=16", NULL);
// run model
ml_train_model_run(model, "epochs=2", "save_path=model.bin", NULL);

// destroy after use
ml_train_model_destroy(model);
```

A number of properties can be set at `ml_train_model_compile()` and `ml_train_model_run()` phase:

Function | Key | Value | Description
-------- | --- | ----- | -----------
`ml_train_model_compile()` | loss      | (categorical)| Loss function to be set
&#xfeff;                 |           | cross        | cross-entropy loss
&#xfeff;                 |           | mse          | mean squared error
`ml_train_model_run()`     | epochs    | (integer)    | Determines epochs for the model
&#xfeff;                 | save_path | (file_path)  | Model path to save and read parameters

### Layer

Layer is a component that does actual computation while managing internal trainable parameters.
Currently, input layer and fully connected layer type are supported:

```c
// Create layer
ml_train_layer_h layer;
ml_train_layer_create(&layer, ML_TRAIN_LAYER_TYPE_FC);

// configure layer
ml_train_set_property(layer, "unit=10", "activation=softmax", "bias_initializer=zeros", NULL);

// after adding the layer to model,
// you do not need to destroy layer since ownership is transferred to the model.
ml_train_model_add_layer(model, layer);
```

Following are the available properties for each layer type:

Type | Key | value | Description
---------- | --- | ----- | -----------

&#xfeff;                    |                    | he_uniform    | He Uniform Initialization
&#xfeff;                    | bias_initializer   | (categorical) | Bias initializer, same category as `weight_initializer`
&#xfeff;                    | weight_regularizer | (categorical) | Weight regularizer. Currently, only l2norm is supported
&#xfeff;                    |                    | l2norm        | L2 weight regularizer
&#xfeff;                    | weight_regularizer_constant | (float)| weight regularizer constant
&#xfeff;                    | flatten            | (boolean)     | flatten shape from `c:h:w` to `1:1:c*h*w`

&#xfeff;                    | normalization      | (boolean)     | normalize input if true
&#xfeff;                    | standardization    | (boolean)     | standardize input if true
`ML_TRAIN_LAYER_TYPE_FC`    |                    |               | Fully connected layer
&#xfeff;                    | unit               | (integer)     | number of outputs

### Optimizer

Optimizer determines how to update model parameters according to loss from prediction.
Currently, Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer and Adam optimizer are supported:

```c
// Create an optimizer
ml_train_optimizer_h optimizer;
ml_train_optimizer_create(&optimizer, ML_TRAIN_OPTIMIZER_TYPE_SGD);

// Configure a optimizer
ml_train_optimizer_set_property(optimizer, "learning_rate=0.001", NULL);

// Set optimizer to the model
// No need to destroy optimizer after setting optimizer since the ownership is transferred to the model.
ml_train_model_set_optimizer(model, optimizer);
```

Following are the available properties for each optimizer type:

Type | Key | value | Description
---------- | --- | ----- | -----------
(Universal properties)                   |                    |               | Universal properties that applies to every layer
&#xfeff;                            | learning_rate      | (float)       | Initial learning rate for the optimizer
`ML_TRAIN_OPTIMIZER_TYPE_SGD`       |                    |               | Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer
`ML_TRAIN_OPTIMIZER_TYPE_ADAM`      |                    |               | Adam optimizer
&#xfeff;                            | decay_steps        | (float)       | Decay steps
&#xfeff;                            | decay_rate         | (float)       | Decay rate
&#xfeff;                            | beta1              | (float)       | beta1 coefficient for adam
&#xfeff;                            | beta2              | (float)       | beta2 coefficient for adam
&#xfeff;                            | epsilon            | (float)       | epsilon coefficient for adam

### Dataset

Dataset is in charge of feeding data into the model.
The dataset can either be created from a callback function or created from a file.
For more information, see [configure the model](#configure-the-model) section.

Following code is example of handling dataset:

```c
// Create dataset
ml_train_dataset_h dataset;
ml_train_dataset_create_with_generator(&dataset, generator_train_cb, generator_valid_cb, generator_test_cb);

// configure dataset
ml_train_dataset_set_property(dataset, "buffer_size=100", NULL);

// after setting a dataset to model,
// you do not need to destroy dataset since ownership is transferred to the model.
ml_train_model_set_dataset(model, dataset);
```

## Construct a model

A model can be constructed with `ml_train_model_construct()`.
If you have a file that describes the model, the file can be used to construct initially with `ml_train_model_construct_with_file()`.
Even if the model is constructed from a file, switching, modifying, or setting a component is possible until you compile with `ml_train_model_compile()`.

### Construct a model from a description file

As of now, only INI formatted files `*.ini` is supported to construct a model from a file.

#### Create a model from INI formatted file

Special sections `[Model]` and `[Dataset]` are respectively referring to `model` and `dataset` object.
Rest of INI sections map to a `layer`. Keys and values from each section set properties of the layer.
All keys and values are treated as case-insensitive.

Following is an example of the `*.ini` file:

```ini
[Model] # Special section that describes model itself
Type = NeuralNetwork  # Model type : only NeuralNetwork is supported as of now
Optimizer = adam  # Optimizer : Adaptive Moment Estimation(adam)

#### optimizer related properties
Learning_rate = 0.0001  # Learning rate for the optimizer
Decay_rate = 0.96 # The decay rate for decaying the learning rate
Decay_steps = 1000       # decay step for the exponentially decayed learning rate
beta1 = 0.9     # beta 1 for adam
beta2 = 0.9999  # beta 2 for adam
epsilon = 1e-7  # epsilon for adam

#### Model compile related properties
batch_size = 9
loss = cross      # Cost(loss) function : cross entropy(cross)

####  Model run related properties
Epochs = 20     # Epochs
save_path = "model.bin"   # model path to save and read parameters

[DataSet] # Special section that describes dataset
BufferSize=9
TrainData="trainingSet.dat"
ValidData="validationSet.dat"
LabelData="label.dat"

# Layer Sections, each section name refers to name of the layer
[inputlayer]
Type = input
Input_Shape = 1:1:62720 # Input dimension in channel:height:width
Normalization = true

[outputlayer]
Type = fully_connected
Unit = 2    # Width of output dimension
bias_initializer = zeros
weight_initializer = xavier_uniform
Activation = sigmoid  # activation : sigmoid, softmax
weight_regularizer = l2norm
weight_regularizer_constant = 0.005
```

The following restrictions must be adhered to:

 - Model file must have a `[Model]` section.
 - Model file must have at least one layer.
 - Valid keys must have valid properties. The invalid keys in each section is ignored.

> [!NOTE]
> All paths are relative to the current working directory unless stating an absolute path.
> Set `save_path` and `Dataset` from the code rather than describing inside the model file.

Following example constructs model from INI file:

```c
char *res_path = app_get_resource_path();
char model_path[1024];
ml_train_model_h model;

snprintf(model_path, sizeof(model_path), "%s/model.ini", res_path);
free(res_path);

status = ml_train_model_construct_with_conf(model_path, &model);
if(status != ML_ERROR_NONE) {
  // handle error
}
```

### Construct a model on code

An empty model can be constructed with `ml_train_model_construct()`.

## Configure the model

After constructing a model, the model can be configured.

> [!NOTE]
> Example code written here reproduces the model description from [Create Model from INI Formatted File](#create-a-model-from-ini-formatted-file) except that followings are different:
> - Relative path is changed to dynamic app resource and data path.
> - Model related properties that can only be set at compile or run phase.
> - Demonstration about `ml_train_dataset_create_with_generator()`, which cannot be covered in the description file.

First, an empty model needs to be created:

```c
ml_train_model_h model;
ml_train_model_construct(&model);
```

### Add a layer

`ml_train_model_add_layer()` appends a layer to the end of the graph in the model:

```c
int status = ML_ERROR_NONE;
ml_train_layer_h layers[2];

// create and add input layer
status = ml_train_layer_create(&layers[0], ML_TRAIN_LAYER_TYPE_INPUT);
if(status != ML_ERROR_NONE) {
  // handle error
}

status = ml_train_layer_set_property(layers[0], "name=inputlayer",
                                                "input_shape=1:1:62720",
                                                "normalization=true", NULL);
if(status != ML_ERROR_NONE) {
  //handle error
}
status = ml_train_model_add_layer(model, layers[0]);

// create and add fully connected layer
status = ml_train_layer_create(&layers[1], ML_TRAIN_LAYER_TYPE_FC);
status = ml_train_layer_set_property(layers[1], "name=outputlayer",
                                                "unit=2",
                                                "bias_initializer=zeros",
                                                "weight_initializer=xavier_uniform",
                                                "activation=sigmoid", NULL);
status = ml_train_model_add_layer(model, layers[1]);
```

### Set an optimizer

Creating and setting `optimizer` to a model can be done in the same manner as `layer`:

```c
status = ml_train_optimizer_create(&optimizer, ML_TRAIN_OPTIMIZER_TYPE_ADAM);
status = ml_train_optimizer_set_property(optimizer, "learning_rate=0.0001",
                                                    "decay_rate=0.96",
                                                    "decay_steps=1000",
                                                    "beta1=0.002",
                                                    "beta2=0.001",
                                                    "epsilon=1e-7", NULL);
status = ml_train_model_set_optimizer(model, optimizer);
```

### Set a dataset

There are two ways to create a dataset. One is from a file, and the other one is from a callback.
In either case, you need to provide streams of tensor data and arrays of values representing the label, usually one-hot-encoded.

#### Set a dataset from a file

To create a `dataset` from a file, a training set and a label set must be provided. A validation set and a test set can be provided if needed.

A label set is a file that has actual labels each in a line. For example:

```
airplane
automobile
bird
cat
deer
dog
frog
horse
ship
truck
```

Each dataset except for the label set must contain raw float array data and one-hot-encoded labels:

```
[float array for data1][label(on-hot encoded) for data1][float array][label]...
```

After preparing the label set and dataset, create `dataset` as follows:

```c
int status = ML_ERROR_NONE;
ml_train_dataset_h dataset;

char *res_path = app_get_resource_path();
char train_path[1024];
char label_prop[1024];

snprintf(train_path, sizeof(train_path), "%s/training.dat", res_path);
snprintf(label_prop, sizeof(label_prop), "label_data=%s/label.dat", res_path);
free(res_path);

status = ml_train_dataset_create_with_file(&dataset, train_path);
if(status != ML_ERROR_NONE) {
  // handle error
}

status = ml_train_dataset_set_property(dataset, label_prop,
                                   "buffer_size=9", NULL);
status = ml_train_model_set_dataset(model, dataset);
```

`buffer_size` can be set for dataset.

#### Set a dataset from a generator

Creating a dataset from a generator function is also possible.

1. Prepare a callback function:

    ```c
    /**
    * @brief      get data which size is batch for train
    * @param[out] data
    * @param[out] label
    * @param[out] last if the data is finished
    * @param[in] user_data private data for the callback
    * @retval status for handling error
    */
    int get_train_data(float **data, float **label, bool *last, void *user_data) {
      /* code that fills data, label and last */
      return ML_ERROR_NONE;
    }
    ```

2. Create a dataset from the callback function:

    ```c
    int status = ML_ERROR_NONE;
    ml_train_dataset_h dataset;

    // validation and test callback can be omitted.
    status = ml_train_dataset_create_with_generator(&dataset, get_train_data,
                                                    NULL, NULL);
    ```

## Compile the model

Compiling a model finalizes the model with loss.
Once compiled, any modification to the properties of the model is restricted.
Adding layers or changing the optimizer or dataset of the model is not permitted either:

```c
int status = ML_ERROR_NONE;

status = ml_train_model_compile(model, "loss=cross", "batch_size=9", NULL);
```

## Train the model

Now, the model is ready to train. Train model as follows:

```c
int status = ML_ERROR_NONE;

status = ml_train_model_run(model, "epochs=20", "save_path=model.bin", NULL);
```

## Destroy the model

After training, the model must be destroyed with `ml_train_model_destroy()`.
`ml_train_model_add_layer()`, `ml_train_set_optimizer()`, and `ml_train_set_dataset()` transfers ownership to the model.
`layers`, `optimizers` and `dataset` that belongs to the `model` are also deleted.
