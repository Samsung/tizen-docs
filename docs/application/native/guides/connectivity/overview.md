# Connectivity and Wireless


The connectivity and wireless features introduce how you can manage wireless connections to other devices and networks. They also describe how you can download content, and send and receive data in your application.

You can use the following connectivity and wireless features in your native applications:

- [Bluetooth](bluetooth.md)

  You can use Bluetooth functionalities in your application, such as managing the Bluetooth service, pairing, and exchanging messages. The Bluetooth standard provides a peer-to-peer (P2P) data exchange functionality over short distance between compliant devices.

- [Near Field Communication (NFC)](nfc.md)

  You can share contacts, photos, and videos, use the device as a smart card, and communicate with other NFC-enabled devices. You can use an NFC-enabled device to communicate with NFC tags for a variety of activities, such as paying the grocery bill or downloading a coupon.

- [Smart Card](smartcard.md)

  You can use smart card functionalities to access secure elements. You can open a channel to the secure element, send a command, and receive a response.

- [Wi-Fi](wifi.md)

  You can connect to a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and transfer data over the network. You can activate and deactivate a local Wi-Fi device, and to connect to a WLAN network in the infrastructure mode.

- [Wi-Fi Direct&reg;](wifi-direct.md)

  Find a Wi-Fi Direct device, discover its details, and then form a Wi-Fi Direct group to communicate over a peer-to-peer link without using wireless access points (base stations) in the infrastructure mode.

- [Software Access Point (SoftAP)](softap.md)

  You can setup SoftAP for local area connections without Internet.

- [Intelligent Network Monitoring (INM)](inm.md)

  You can get information about the network, provided by Linux functions. You can detect IP collisions, dump network status, dump TCP, monitor ethernet, monitor Wi-Fi module state, and get network statistics.

- [Smart Traffic Control (STC)](stc.md)

  Statistics about network data consumption is fetched by system and applications.

- [Telephony Information](telephony.md)

  1. Access various information about voice and voice call status that currently uses SIM card and Modem from the Telephony Service.
  2. Retrieve general details about the telephony network from the currently connected device.

- [USB Host](usb-host.md)

  You can connect to other devices using USB. You can gather information about the device and find a suitable interface and configuration.

- [Internet and Content Downloads](internet-download.md)

  You can connect to the Internet and access its various services. You can download files, transfer content through socket and libcurl connections, and create a Web view in your application to allow Internet browsing.

- [File Transfer with MTP](mtp.md)

  You can transfer files between 2 devices. You can manage the Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) and get files from the MTP responder.

- [VPN Connections](vpn.md)

  You can allow the users to initialize the VPN device, and manage routing, DNS, and firewall features.

- [IoT Connectivity](iotcon.md)

  In Tizen use IoT Activity feature and seamless device-to-device connectivity to address the needs of the Internet of Things (IoT) through the open source reference implementation of the OIC (Open Interconnect Consortium) standard specifications.

- [Network Service Discovery](nsd.md)

  You can perform network service discoveries to announce local services and search for remote services.
