# Visual Detection and Recognition

You can perform various visual detection and recognition tasks in your application. You can detect or generate barcodes. In addition, you can track how faces or image objects move as well as detect and recognize faces or objects.

You can use the following visual detection and recognition features in your native applications:

- [Barcode Detection and Generation](image-barcode.md)
  
  You can perceive and understand an image or extract information from images in your application. You can encrypt a message by generating a barcode from it, and you can also detect barcodes in an image or from a camera preview stream.

- [Deep Learning Based Face Recognition](face-recognition.md)

  You can register, unregister and recognize a face in your application with more accuracy, which uses Deep Learning technique.

- [Deep Learning Based Face Detection](face-detection.md)

  You can detect faces from an image and get a bounding boxes for the face regions.

- [Deep Learning Based Object Detection](object-detection.md)

  You can detect objects from an image and get bounding boxes for the object regions.

- [Deep Learning Based Image Classification](image-classification.md)
  
  You can classify an image that belongs to corresponding labels.

- [Deep Learning Based Facial Landmark](facial-landmark.md)

  You can detect a face from an image and retrieve its landmark positions.

- [Deep Learning Based Pose Landmark](pose-landmark.md)

  You can detect a human body from an image and retrieve its landmark positions.

- [ROI Tracker](roi-tracker.md)

  You can obtain the proper ROI coordinates that the user wants to track.
