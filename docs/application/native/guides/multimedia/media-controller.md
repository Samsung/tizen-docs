# Media Controller


You can establish communication between a media controller server and a media controller client. You can send commands from the client to the server, and the client can request updated metadata and playback information from the server.

The main features of the Media Controller API include:

- Updating and retrieving information

  You can [update the metadata and playback information](#updating-and-retrieving-information) on the server side, and then retrieve the metadata and playback information on the client side.

  The media controller server provides current information about the registered application that you can send to the client.

  When the client requests the information, the media controller server updates the state information of an active application before transferring the data. If the application is not running when the client request arrives, the media controller server transfers the latest information.

- Updating and retrieving playlist

  You can [update the playlist information](#updating-and-retrieving-playlist) on the server side, and then retrieve the playlist information on the client side.

  The media controller server provides current information about the registered application that you can send to the client.

- Sending and processing commands

  You can [send a command](#sending-and-processing-commands) to the server from the client side and then process the command on the server side.

- Sending and processing commands to receive replies

  You can [send a command](#sending-and-processing-commands-to-receive-replies) to the server from the client side, and then process the command on the server side.

  You can [send a reply of the command](#send_command_reply) to the client from the server side, and then receive the reply on the client side.

- Sending and processing a custom event

  You can [send a custom event](#sending-and-processing-a-custom-event) to the client from the server side and then process the event on the client side.

  You can [send a reply of the custom event](#send_event_reply) to the server from the client side and then receive the reply on the server side.

## Prerequisites

To enable your application to use the media controller functionality:

- To use the media controller server:

  1. To use the functions and data types of the Media Controller Server API (in [mobile](../../api/mobile/latest/group__CAPI__MEDIA__CONTROLLER__SERVER__MODULE.html) and [wearable](../../api/wearable/latest/group__CAPI__MEDIA__CONTROLLER__SERVER__MODULE.html) applications), include the `<media_controller_server.h>` header file in your application:

     ```
     #include <media_controller_server.h>
     ```

  2. To work with the Media Controller Server API, define a handle variable for the media controller server:

     ```
     static mc_server_h g_server_h = NULL;
     ```

     The server updates the metadata and playback information, and processes the requests and commands sent by the client.

     This guide uses a global variable for the handle.

- To use the media controller client:

  1. To use the functions and data types of the Media Controller Client API (in [mobile](../../api/mobile/latest/group__CAPI__MEDIA__CONTROLLER__CLIENT__MODULE.html) and [wearable](../../api/wearable/latest/group__CAPI__MEDIA__CONTROLLER__CLIENT__MODULE.html) applications), include the `<media_controller_client.h>` header file in your application:

     ```
     #include <media_controller_client.h>
     ```

  2. To work with the Media Controller Client API, define a handle variable for the media controller client:

     ```
     static mc_client_h g_client_h = NULL;
     ```

     The client requests metadata and playback information from the server, and sends playback commands to server.

     This guide uses a global variable for the handle.


## Updating and Retrieving Information

To update the metadata and playback information on the server side:

1. Create the media controller server handle using the `mc_server_create()`:

   ```
   ret = mc_server_create(&g_server_h);
   ```

2. Set the metadata or playback information to be updated using the corresponding `mc_server_set_XXX()` and then update the metadata or playback information using the corresponding `mc_server_update_XXX()`.

   For example, to update the playback state information, set the information to be updated using the `mc_server_set_playback_state()` and then update the information using the `mc_server_update_playback_info()`:

   ```
   ret = mc_server_set_playback_state(g_mc_server, MC_PLAYBACK_STATE_PLAYING);

   ret = mc_server_update_playback_info(g_mc_server);
   ```

3. Destroy the media controller server handle using the `mc_server_destroy()`, when media controller server handle is no longer needed:

   ```
   mc_server_destroy(g_server_h);
   ```

To retrieve the metadata and playback information on the client side:

1. Create the media controller client handle using the `mc_client_create()`:

   ```
   ret = mc_client_create(&g_client_h);
   ```

2. Retrieve the server name using the `mc_client_get_latest_server_info()`:

   ```
   char *server_name = NULL;
   mc_server_state_e server_state;

   ret = mc_client_get_latest_server_info(g_mc_client, &server_name, &server_state);
   dlog_print(DLOG_DEBUG, LOG_TAG, "Server Name: %s, Server state: %d\n", server_name, server_state);
   ```

3. Retrieve the metadata or playback information from the server using the corresponding `mc_client_get_server_XXX()`. Use the server name retrieved in the previous step to identify the server.

   For example, to retrieve the playback information from the server, use the `mc_client_get_server_playback_info()`:

   ```
   mc_playback_h playback = NULL;
   mc_playback_states_e playback_state;

   ret = mc_client_get_server_playback_info(g_client_h, server_name, &playback);

   ret = mc_client_get_playback_state(playback, &playback_state);
   dlog_print(DLOG_DEBUG, LOG_TAG, "Playback State: %d\n", playback_state);
   ```

   The `mc_client_get_playback_state()` retrieves the playback state from the playback information returned by the `mc_client_get_server_playback_info()`.

4. Destroy the media controller client handle using the `mc_client_destroy()`, when media controller client handle is no longer needed:

   ```
   mc_client_destroy(g_client_h);
   ```


## Updating and Retrieving Playlist

To update the playlist and metadata information on the server side:

1. Create the media controller server handle using the `mc_server_create()`:

   ```
   ret = mc_server_create(&g_server_h);
   ```
2. Create the playlist handle using the `mc_server_create_playlist()`:

   ```
   mc_playlist_h playlist_h = NULL;

   ret = mc_server_create_playlist(g_server_h, "playlist", &playlist_h);
   ```
3. Set the metadata information in the playlist handle to be updated using the corresponding `mc_server_add_item_to_playlist()` and then update the playlist using the corresponding `mc_server_update_playlist_done()`:

   ```
   mc_server_add_item_to_playlist(g_server_h, playlist_h, "1", MC_META_MEDIA_TITLE, "title_1");
   mc_server_add_item_to_playlist(g_server_h, playlist_h, "1", MC_META_MEDIA_ARTIST, "artist_1");
   mc_server_add_item_to_playlist(g_server_h, playlist_h, "1", MC_META_MEDIA_ALBUM, "album_1");
   mc_server_add_item_to_playlist(g_server_h, playlist_h, "1", MC_META_MEDIA_AUTHOR, "author_1");
   mc_server_add_item_to_playlist(g_server_h, playlist_h, "1", MC_META_MEDIA_GENRE, "genre_1");
   mc_server_add_item_to_playlist(g_server_h, playlist_h, "1", MC_META_MEDIA_DURATION, "duration_1");
   mc_server_add_item_to_playlist(g_server_h, playlist_h, "1", MC_META_MEDIA_DATE, "date_1");
   mc_server_add_item_to_playlist(g_server_h, playlist_h, "1", MC_META_MEDIA_COPYRIGHT, "copyright_1");
   mc_server_add_item_to_playlist(g_server_h, playlist_h, "1", MC_META_MEDIA_DESCRIPTION, "desc_1");
   mc_server_add_item_to_playlist(g_server_h, playlist_h, "1", MC_META_MEDIA_TRACK_NUM, "tracknum_1");
   mc_server_add_item_to_playlist(g_server_h, playlist_h, "1", MC_META_MEDIA_PICTURE, "picture_1");

   ret = mc_server_update_playlist_done(g_server_h, playlist_h);
   ```
4. When no longer needed, destroy the playlist handle using the `mc_playlist_destroy()`:

   ```
   mc_playlist_destroy(playlist_h);
   ```
5. Destroy the media controller server handle using the `mc_server_destroy()`, when media controller server handle is no longer needed:

   ```
   mc_server_destroy(g_server_h);
   ```

To retrieve the playlist and metadata information on the client side:

1. Create the media controller client handle using the `mc_client_create()`:

   ```
   ret = mc_client_create(&g_client_h);
   ```
2. Define the callback that is invoked when the client receives the playlist:

   ```
   void
   playlist_updated_cb(const char *server_name, mc_playlist_update_mode_e mode, const char *playlist_name, mc_playlist_h playlist, void *user_data)
   {
       dlog_print(DLOG_DEBUG, LOG_TAG, "Server Name: %s, Playlist Update Mode: %d, Playlist Name: %s\n", server_name, mode, playlist_name);
   }
   ```

   If you want to use playlist handle outside, make a copy using `mc_playlist_clone()`.

3. Register the callback using the `mc_client_set_playlist_updated_cb()`:

   ```
   ret = mc_client_set_playlist_updated_cb(g_client_h, playlist_updated_cb, NULL);
   ```
4. Define the callback that retrieve the item from the playlist handle:

   ```
   bool
   playlist_item_cb(const char *index, mc_metadata_h metadata, void *user_data)
   {
     dlog_print(DLOG_DEBUG, LOG_TAG, "Index: %s\n", index);
   }
   ```

   If you want to use metadata handle outside, make a copy using `mc_metadata_clone()`.

5. Register the callback using the `mc_playlist_foreach_item()`:

   ```
   ret = mc_playlist_foreach_item(playlist_h, playlist_item_cb, NULL);
   ```

6. Retrieve the metadata information from the metadata handle using the `mc_metadata_get()`:

   ```
   char *title = NULL;
   ret = mc_metadata_get(metadata_h, MC_META_MEDIA_TITLE, &title);
   ```

7. When no longer needed, destroy the playlist handle using the `mc_playlist_destroy()`:

   ```
   mc_playlist_destroy(playlist_h);
   ```

8. Destroy the media controller client handle using the `mc_client_destroy()`, when media controller client handle is no longer needed:
