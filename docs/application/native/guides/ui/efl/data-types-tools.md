# Data Types and Tools

UI toolkits, such as Qt and Gtk, generally support their own data types, structures, functions, and macros in order for you to easily and efficiently make their applications. EFL, as one of Tizen native UI toolkits, provides data types and useful tools as well.

The Eina library in EFL implements APIs for data types and structures easy to use and optimized in an efficient way. It also provides some useful tools, such as opening shared libraries, error management, type conversion, time accounting, and memory pool to help convenient application development.

The main features of Eina are:

- [Data Types](data-types.md)

  The Eina library is a central part of the EFL. It implements an API for data types, and allows you to create and manipulate several data types.

- [Tools](tools.md)

  Eina provides a number of tools, such as string manipulation, that make your life easier when coding applications.
