# Genlist

This feature is supported in wearable applications only.

Genlist is a UI component that displays a scrollable list of items. It allows you to manage a lot of items while still being fast and having a low memory footprint, as only the visible items are allocated in the memory.

For more information, see the [Genlist](../../../../api/wearable/latest/group__Elm__Genlist.html) API.

## Adding a Genlist Component

To add a genlist component, use the `elm_genlist_add()` function:

```
Evas_Object *genlist;
Evas_Object *parent;

genlist = elm_genlist_add(parent);
```

## Using the Genlist Item Styles

An item can have 0 or more texts, 0 or more contents, and 0 or more boolean states. This is defined in the Edje item theme style. The genlist looks for data items named respectively `labels`, `contents`, and `states` in the Edje file. The `default` item style provides 1 text part (`elm.text`), 2 content parts (`elm.swallow.icon` and `elm.swallow.end`), and no state parts.

The following item styles are available:

- `default`
- `title`
- `title_with_groupindex`
- `groupindex`
- `1text`
- `1text.1icon`
- `2text`
- `2text.1`
- `1text.1icon.divider`
- `1text.1icon.1`
- `2text.1icon.1`
- `multiline/1text`
- `multiline/2text`
- `padding`

The following figures show examples of the item styles.

## Defining the Genlist Item Class

To save memory and speed up processing when many items exist, the genlist uses the concept of "realization" when managing items. It means that a genlist item creates its text and content (realizes) when the user scrolls the list and the item shows up on the screen, and frees them (unrealizes) when the item is scrolled out of the screen. To enable the item realization, you must create and fill an `Elm_Genlist_Item_Class` structure (genlist item class) that informs the genlist component which callbacks to call when an item is created or deleted.

You can use the genlist item class for the following purposes:

- Setting the item styles
- Registering callback functions for item realization
- Registering a callback function for item deletion

```
Elm_Genlist_Item_Class *itc = elm_genlist_item_class_new();

itc->item_style = "default";
itc->decorate_item_style = NULL;
itc->decorate_all_item_style = NULL;
itc->func.text_get = _item_label_get;
itc->func.content_get = _item_content_get;
itc->func.state_get = _item_state_get;
itc->func.del = _item_del;
```

The `item_style`, `decorate_item_style`, and `decorate_all_item_style` attributes define the names of the item style, the decorate mode item style, and the decorate all item style.

The `func` structure contains pointers to functions that are called when an item is going to be realized or deleted. All of them receive a data parameter that points to the same data passed to the `elm_genlist_item_append()` function and related item creation functions, and an `obj` parameter that points to the genlist object itself.

- `text_get()`
  The `PART` parameter is the name string of one of the existing text parts in the Edje group implementing the item's theme. It has to return a string (duplicated with the `strdup()` function) corresponding to the `PART` parameter. The caller is in charge of freeing the string when done.

- `content_get()`
  The `PART` parameter is the name string of one of the existing swallow parts in the Edje group. The function returns a valid object handle, or `NULL` when no content is desired. The object is deleted by the genlist on its deletion or when the item is `unrealized`.

- `state_get()`
  The `PART` parameter is the name string of one of the state parts in the Edje group implementing the item's theme. It returns `EINA_FALSE` for false/off or `EINA_TRUE` for true/on. The default is false. When the state is true, the genlist emits a signal to the `PART` parameter's theming Edje object using `elm,state,xxx,active` as the `emission` parameter and `elm` as the `source` parameter. xxx is the name of the (state) part.

- `del()`
  This function is called when the genlist item is deleted. It deletes any data that is allocated at the item creation.

## Managing Genlist Items

To manage items:

- Add items:

  - To add an item to the end of the list (or if there is a parent list, to the end of all the child items of the parent list), use the `elm_genlist_item_append()` function.
  - To add an item to the beginning of the list or parent list, use the similar `elm_genlist_item_prepend()` function.
  - To insert an item before the indicated item, use the `elm_genlist_item_insert_before()` function.
  - To insert an item after the indicated item, use the `elm_genlist_item_insert_after()` function.

  The functions take one of the following `type` parameters:

  - `ELM_GENLIST_ITEM_NONE`
  - `ELM_GENLIST_ITEM_TREE`

    The item is displayed as being able to expand and have child items. In the wearable profile, the genlist tree item style is not supported yet.

  - `ELM_GENLIST_ITEM_GROUP`

    The item is a group index item that is displayed at the top until the next group appears.

- Delete items and clear the list:

  - To delete a single genlist item, use the `elm_object_item_del()` function.
  - To clear the list and delete all items, use the `elm_genlist_clear()` function.
  - To delete all items that are children of the indicated parent item, use the `elm_genlist_item_subitems_clear()` function.

- Inspect list elements:

  To help inspect the list items, move to the item at the top of the list with the `elm_genlist_first_item_get()` function, which returns the item pointer. The `elm_genlist_last_item_get()` function moves to the item at the end of the list. The `elm_genlist_item_next_get()` and `elm_genlist_item_prev_get()` functions move to the next and previous items relative to the indicated item. Using these calls you can go through the entire item list or tree.

  > **Note**
  >
  > As a tree, the items are flattened on the list, so the `elm_genlist_item_parent_get()` function gives you the name of the parent item (even to skip them if needed).

  The `elm_genlist_item_show()` function scrolls the scroller to show the desired item as visible.

  The `elm_object_item_data_get()` function returns the data pointer set by the item creation functions.

- Update items:

  If an item changes (state, boolean, text or content change), use the `elm_genlist_item_update()` function for the genlist to update the item. Genlist re-realizes the item and calls the functions in the `_Elm_Genlist_Item_Class` class for it.

## Selecting Genlist Items

To select or deselect items manually, use the `elm_genlist_item_selected_set()` function. To expand or collapse a tree or group item, use the `elm_genlist_item_expanded_set()` function.

To prevent a selection, you can disable an item with the `elm_object_item_disabled_set()` function.

> **Note**
>
> Calling this function does not show or hide any child of an item (if it is a parent). You must manually delete and create them on the callbacks of the `expanded` or `contracted` signals.

## Using the Genlist Callbacks

To receive notifications about the genlist events, listen for the following signals:

- `activated`: The item is double-clicked or pressed (enter | return | spacebar).

  The `event_info` callback parameter points at an `Elm_Object_Item` object that contains the activated item.

- `clicked,double`: The item is double-clicked.

  The `event_info` callback parameter points at an `Elm_Object_Item` object that contains the double-clicked item.

- `selected`: The item is selected.

  The `event_info` callback parameter points at an `Elm_Object_Item` object that contains the selected item.

  The `event_info` callback parameter points at an `Elm_Object_Item` object that contains the unselected item.
