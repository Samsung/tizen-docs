# Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL)

Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) is an open source UI toolkit that provides a set of libraries that offer useful features to applications. EFL covers a number of areas from UI component sets to data structures. EFL is one of the Tizen native UI modules and is available in various Tizen profiles. In Tizen, EFL is commonly used for UI applications, although you can also use it for non-UI applications.

The EFL UI programming guide includes the following topics:

- [Introduction](index.md)

  Covers theoretical information including what EFL is and how it works.

- [Getting Started](getting-started.md)

  Covers a practical guide to start programming.

- [Programming Principles](programming-principles.md)

  Covers programming including the concept of object type or the range of the API domain.

- [Building UI Layouts](ui-layouts.md)

  Enables you to create layouts using container UI components.

- [UI Components](ui-components.md)

  Enables you to handle Elementary UI components.

- [Scaling](ui-scalability.md)

  Enables you to manage various screen and object sizes.

- [Fonts](font-setting.md)

  Enables you get and set font information.

- [Layouting with EDC](learn-edc-intro.md)

  Enables you to create application layouts using EDC scripting.

- [Primitive Graphical Objects](graphical-objects.md)

  Enables you to manage and render Evas objects.

- [Evas Rendering Concept and Method](evas-rendering.md)

  Enables you to understand how Evas rendering works.

- [Transformation with Evas Map](evas-map-animation.md)

  Enables you to apply transformations to all object types through UV mapping.

- [Animations and Effects](animation-effects.md)

  Enables you to create physics-related animations and effects.

- [Core Loop and OS Interfacing](core-loop.md)

  Enables you to use the main loop and handle threads.

- [Event Handling](event-handling.md)

  Enables you to manage polling, timers, events, and file descriptors.

- [Data Types and Tools](data-types-tools.md)

  Enables you to take advantage of data types and tools used in multiple places.

- [Hardware Input Handling](hw-input.md)

  Enables you to use the EFL extension to manage hardware input events.

- [Accessibility](accessibility.md)

  Enables you to build accessible applications for low-vision and visually-impaired users.

- [EFL Utilities](efl-util.md)

  Enables you to handle notification windows and input generators, and take screenshots.
