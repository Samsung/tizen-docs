# Dynamic Animation Library (DALi)
## Dependencies
- Tizen 2.4 and Higher for Mobile
- Tizen 3.0 and Higher for Wearable

DALi is a cross-platform 3D UI Toolkit for embedded systems. Its 3D user interface engine enables you to create rich and high-performance UI applications. DALi is based on OpenGL® ES 2.0 and 3.0, but provides a clean cross-platform C++ framework. This means that you can use high-level DALi APIs instead of accessing low-level OpenGL® APIs directly. DALi is multithreaded to improve performance and scalability.

DALi enables developers to quickly create Rich UI applications with realistic effects and animations such as:

 + Image & Video galleries
 + Music players
 + Games
 + Maps
 + Homescreens / launch pads
 + Advanced watch faces for wearable devices
