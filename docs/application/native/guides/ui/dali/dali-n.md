DALi is a cross-platform 3D UI Toolkit for embedded systems. Its 3D user interface engine enables you to create rich and high-performance UI applications. DALi is based on OpenGL&reg; ES 2.0, but provides a clean cross-platform C++ framework. This means that you can use high-level DALi APIs instead of accessing low-level OpenGL&reg; APIs directly.

When creating a DALi application, make sure you understand the following main features:

- [DALi Overview](dali-overview-n.md)

  Enables you to get started with the DALi UI programming.


- [Actors](actors-n.md)

  Enables you to handle DALi actors.


- [Event Handling](event-handling-n.md)

  Enables you to handle DALi events.


- [UI Components](ui-components-n.md)

  Enables you to handle DALi UI components.


- [Animation](animation-n.md)

  Enables you to create animated effects.


- [Resources](resources-n.md)

  Enables you to manage resource images.


- [Rendering and Effects](rendering-effects-n.md)

  Enables you to manage DALi viewing modes.


- [Background Knowledge](background-n.md)

  Enables you to use DALi more effectively with background knowledge.
