# Text Input and Voice


The text input and voice features introduce how you can convert speech to text and back to speech, and provide customized keyboards and voice control.

You can use the following text input and voice features in your native applications:

- [Input Method](input-method.md)

  You can create an IME (Input Method Editor) application that provides a customized keyboard for the user. You can show and hide the keyboard as needed, and offer a keyboard option menu to allow the user to manage the keyboard settings.

- [Speech-to-text](stt.md)

  You can recognize sound data recorded by the user and send the result as text. The result text can, for example, be displayed on the screen.

- [Text-to-speech](tts.md)

  You can synthesize text into sound data as utterances and play it. You can also control the playback by pausing, resuming, and stopping it, as needed.

- [Voice Control](voice-control.md)

  You can allow the user to control the device through voice commands. You can register voice commands, which trigger a callback when the user speaks them. Voice commands registered for EFL-supported UI components can be used to perform component-related actions, such as button clicks.
