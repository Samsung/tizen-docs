# Text Input

The text input feature introduces how to control customized keyboards and retrieve previous data in a text input field.

You can use the following text input features in your native applications:

- [Input Method](input-method.md)

  You can create an Input Method Editor (IME) application that provides a customized keyboard for the user. You can show and hide the keyboard as needed, and offer a keyboard option menu to allow the user to manage the keyboard settings.

- [Autofill](autofill.md)

  You can retrieve the previously entered data stored in an autofill service.

- [Autofill Service](autofill-service.md)

  You can create an autofill service application that saves and provides the data previously entered by the user.

- [Autofill Manager](autofill-manager.md)

  You can create an Autofill manager application that shows installed Autofill service and switches to the selected Autofill service.
