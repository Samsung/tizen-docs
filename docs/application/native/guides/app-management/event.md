# Event Broadcast and Subscription


The application can broadcast its own events to all listeners, and subscribe to events. The events can be either predefined system [events from the platform](#platform) (only platform modules can broadcast system events) or user-defined events (broadcast by UI and service applications).

The main features of the Event API are:

- Event publication

  You can [publish an event](#broadcast) using the `event_publish_app_event()` and `event_publish_trusted_app_event()` functions. The `event_publish_trusted_app_event()` function publishes a trusted event which can only be received by the application that has the same signature as the publishing application.

- Event subscription

  You can [subscribe to an event](#manage) using the `event_add_event_handler()` function. When no longer needed, unsubscribe the event with the `event_remove_event_handler()` function.

- Launch-On-Events

  Service applications can be [launched when a desired target event occurs](#launch).

The application can be suspended while in the background, causing a pause in event handling. Since the application cannot receive events in the suspended state, they are all delivered in series after the application exits the suspended state. Consider how to manage this situation and prevent the application from being flooded with events:

- To handle events in the background without going to a suspended state, [declare a background category](../applications/efl-ui-app.md#allow_bg).
- To avoid receiving any events that are triggered while the application is suspended, remove the event handler before entering the suspended state and add it back after exiting the suspended state. You can [manage the event handler](../applications/efl-ui-app.md#callback) addition and removal in the `APP_EVENT_SUSPENDED_STATE_CHANGED` event callback, which is triggered each time the application enters and exist the suspended state.

## Prerequisites

To enable your application to use the event functionality:

1. To use the functions and data types of the Event API (in [mobile](../../api/mobile/latest/group__CAPI__EVENT__MODULE.html) and [wearable](../../api/wearable/latest/group__CAPI__EVENT__MODULE.html) applications), include the `<app_event.h>` header file in your application:

   ```
   #include <app_event.h>
   ```

2. To use Launch-On-Events in your application, define the `http://tizen.org/appcontrol/operation/launch_on_event` operation in the `tizen-manifest.xml` file.

   The URI name for the operation represents the event name in the Launch-On-Event format (`event://{Event_Name}`).

   ```
   <app-control>
      <operation name="http://tizen.org/appcontrol/operation/launch_on_event"/>
      <uri name="event://tizen.system.event.battery_charger_status"/>
   </app-control>
   ```

<a name="broadcast"></a>
## Publishing an Event

To publish an event to all listeners:

1. Create the callback for handling the event:

   ```
   static void
   user_event_cb(const char *event_name, bundle *event_data, void *user_data)
   {
       dlog_print(DLOG_INFO, LOG_TAG, "user_event_cb: %s \n", event_name);

       return;
   }
   ```

2. Register the event handler and create the bundle for handling the event data:

   ```
   int ret = EVENT_ERROR_NONE;
   event_handler_h event_handler;
   bundle *event_data = NULL;

   ret = event_add_event_handler("event.org.tizen.senderapp.user_event",
                                 user_event_cb, "CUSTOM_EVENT_KEY", &event_handler);

   if (ret != EVENT_ERROR_NONE)
       dlog_print(DLOG_ERROR, LOG_TAG, "err: [%d]", ret);

   event_data = bundle_create();

   ret = bundle_add_str(event_data, user_data_key, user_data);
   ```

3. Use the `event_publish_app_event()` function to publish the event:

   ```
   ret = event_publish_app_event("event.org.tizen.senderapp.user_event", event_data);

   if (ret != EVENT_ERROR_NONE)
       dlog_print(DLOG_ERROR, LOG_TAG, "err: [%d]", ret);
   ```

4. When no longer needed, free the bundle:

   ```
   ret = bundle_free(event_data);
   ```

## Subscribing to an Event

To subscribe to a predefined system event or user-defined event:

1. Add an event handler.

   One event can have multiple event handlers, and one handler can be registered multiple times.

   - Add an event handler for a system event:

     ```
     static void
     battery_event_callback(const char *event_name, bundle *event_data, void *user_data)
     {
         /* event_name is the event name */
         dlog_print(DLOG_INFO, LOG_TAG, "event_name is [%s]", event_name);

         /* event_data is the event data, its type is bundle */
         char *battery_level_status = NULL;
         battery_level_status = bundle_get_val(event_data, EVENT_KEY_BATTERY_LEVEL_STATUS);
     }

     event_handler_h handler;

     /* Register the event handler */
     int ret = event_add_event_handler(SYSTEM_EVENT_BATTERY_LEVEL_STATUS,
                                       (event_cb)battery_event_cb, user_data, &handler);
     if (ret != EVENT_ERROR_NONE)
         dlog_print(DLOG_ERROR, LOG_TAG, "err: [%d]", ret);
     ```

   - Add an event handler for a user-defined event:

     When defining an event name for a user event (such as `event.org.tizen.senderapp.user_event`), the name format is `event.{sender appid}.{user-defined name}`. The `{user-defined name}` must:

     - Contain only the ASCII characters "[A-Z][a-z][0-9]_" and not begin with a digit.
     - Not contain the '.' (period) character.
     - Not exceed the maximum name length (127 bytes).
     - Be at least 1 byte in length.

     ```
     ret = event_add_event_handler("event.org.tizen.senderapp.user_event",
                                   utc_event_cb_with_valid_check,
                                   "CUSTOM_EVENT_KEY", &event_handler);

     if (ret != EVENT_ERROR_NONE)
         dlog_print(DLOG_ERROR, LOG_TAG, "err: [%d]", ret);
     ```

2. When no longer needed, remove the event handler.

   A registered handler can be removed when application is running, and all registered handlers are removed when the application is terminated.

   ```
   ret = event_remove_event_handler(handler);
   if (ret != EVENT_ERROR_NONE)
       dlog_print(DLOG_ERROR, LOG_TAG, "err: [%d]", ret);
   ```

## Managing Launch-On-Events

To register an interest in a Launch-On-Event, define the `http://tizen.org/appcontrol/operation/launch_on_event` operation in the `tizen-manifest.xml` file.

> **Note**
>
> Only service applications can register and receive Launch-On-Events.
>
> The Launch-On-Event operation cannot be requested using the `app_control_send_launch_request()` function, unlike other application control operations.

The following table shows the system events that support Launch-On-Event.

**Table: System events supporting Launch-On-Event**

| Name                                     | Condition                                |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `tizen.system.event.battery_charger_status` | When the charger state is `"connected"`. |
| `tizen.system.event.usb_status`          | When the USB state is `"connected"`.     |
| `tizen.system.event.earjack_status`      | When the earjack status is `"connected"`. |
| `tizen.system.event.incoming_msg`        | When the `msg_type` and `msg_id` exist.  |
| `tizen.system.event.wifi_state`          | When the Wi-Fi state is `"connected"`.   |

To receive the Launch-On-Event:

```
static void
*app_control(app_control_h app_control, void *data)
{
    char *event_uri = "event://tizen.system.event.battery_charger_status";
    char *operation;
    char *uri;
    char *event_value;
    ret = app_control_get_operation(app_control, &operation);

    if (ret == APP_CONTROL_ERROR_NONE && operation &&
        strcmp(operation, APP_CONTROL_OPERATION_LAUNCH_ON_EVENT) == 0) {
        ret = app_control_get_uri(app_control, &uri);
        if (ret == APP_CONTROL_ERROR_NONE && uri) {
            if (strncmp(uri, event_uri, strlen(event_uri) + 1) == 0) {
                ret = app_control_get_extra_data(app_control, "battery_charger_status", &event_value);
                if (ret == APP_CONTROL_ERROR_NONE && event_value)
                    free(event_value);
                /* Use event_add_event_handler() for further event subscriptions here */
            }
            free(uri);
        }
        free(operation);
    }
}
```

The application can get the event name and data in the first `app_control_cb()` callback, which is called after the application state changes to `created`.
