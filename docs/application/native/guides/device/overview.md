# Device Settings and Systems


The device settings and systems features introduce how you can set and get information about the system. You can also access information about attached devices, and display the application output on an external device screen.

You can use the following device settings and systems features in your native applications:

- [Attached Devices](attached-devices.md)

  You can control any external devices attached to the actual user device, and monitor changes in their state. For example, you can access information about the device battery, display, camera flash LED, and power state.

- [External Output Devices](ext-output.md)

  You can control external output devices, allowing you to display the application screen on a separate device. You can manage the presentation mode, receive information and notifications from the device, and set the attributes for the external output.
