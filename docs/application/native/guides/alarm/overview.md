# Alarms and Scheduling


The alarms and scheduling features introduce how you can define and store alarms. You can use the alarm trigger to launch applications as and when the user needs them. In addition, you can define rules as combination of a contextual event, conditions, and an action.

You can use the following alarms and scheduling features in your native applications:

- [Alarms](alarms.md)

  You can define individual or recurring alarms and store them on the device. The alarm can trigger at specific times or on a specific date. When the alarm is triggered, it launches a specified application using the application control mechanism.

- [Contextual System Event Trigger](trigger.md) **in mobile applications only**

  You can create rules (contextual triggers consisting of an event, conditions, and an action) to monitor the device status or user activities. When the rule is enabled, the system starts to monitor the device status or user activities. When a specific event with certain conditions occurs, a defined action is triggered.
