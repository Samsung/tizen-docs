## Non-API Bound Privileges

Tizen application privileges are loosely bound to APIs, so most of the privileges can be identified by the APIs that the application calls. However, there are some privileges that are not coupled with the Tizen APIs. To allow easy identification, those privileges are mapped to corresponding system resources that are similar to other privileges.

The following table lists the non-API bound privileges:

**Table: Non-API bound privileges**

| Privilege      | Level          | Privacy        | Since          | Description    |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| `http://tizen.org/privilege/mediastorage` | public | Storage | 4.0 | When you connect the device to a computer (Windows&reg; or macOS) through USB, you can access a dedicated media storage area shown as massive media storage. This region of the storage is called media storage and is usually used for multimedia files, such as photos, videos, and music files. Since this storage area is used for user private data, access to it must be protected with a privilege.<br> If your application does not have this privilege, no file operations into the media storage area succeed and you receive a permission denied error. If you have this privilege, you can read and write directories and files, create new files, and delete files in the storage area.      |
| `http://tizen.org/privilege/externalstorage` | public | Storage | 4.0 | Similar to the media storage, many devices support external storages, such as MicroSD card or USB memory. As with the media storage, the access to an external storage must be protected with a privilege.<br> If your application does not have this privilege, all file operations fail with a permission denied error. If you have this privilege, you have full access to the external storage. |
