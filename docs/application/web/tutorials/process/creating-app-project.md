# Creating the Application Project

You can create a Web application project by selecting from a variety of
templates and samples. The following instructions are specific for
creating the project with a template.

To create a Web application project:

1.  In Tizen Studio, select **File &gt; New &gt; Tizen Project**.

    The Project Wizard opens.

2.  In the Project Wizard, define the project details.

    The Project Wizard is used to create the basic application skeleton
    with the required folder structure and mandatory files. You can
    easily create different applications by selecting an applicable
    template or sample for the Project Wizard to use.

    1.  Select the **Template** project type and click **Next**.

    2.  Select the profile (**Mobile**, **Wearable**, or **TV**) and
      version from a drop-down list and click **Next**.  
        >  **Note**  
        > If you cannot see the TV profile option, open the Package Manager and make sure that you have installed the TV extension packages in the **Extension SDK** tab.

    5. Define the project properties and click **Finish**.  
       You can fill the project name. You can also select the location and working sets by clicking **More properties**.  
       >  **Note**  
       > The Tizen API names cannot be used as project names. The project name must be more than 2 characters and is restricted to the following regular expression: \[a-zA-Z\]\[a-zA-Z0-9-\]{2,49}.

      The Project Wizard sets up the project, creates the application files using the default content from the template, and closes. For more information on the Project Wizard and the available templates, see [Creating Tizen Projects with Tizen Project Wizard](../../../tizen-studio/web-tools/project-wizard.md).

The new application project is shown in the **Project Explorer** view of Tizen Studio, with default content in the `config.xml` file as well as in several project folders.
