# Setting Project Properties

Before you implement the actual application functionality, define all the necessary properties for your application project:

- To set the application project properties for [build](#set) and [JSON properties](#set_json), right-click the project in Tizen Studio **Project Explorer** view and select **Properties**. After setting or changing a property, click **OK**.
- To define the [Web application configuration](#set_widget), edit the `config.xml` file.  
  > **Note**  
  > Only modify the Web application configuration by using the
    configuration editor in Tizen Studio. If you create or edit the    `config.xml` file using any other text editor, your application may    not work as expected.

After you have finished setting the project properties, you are ready to [design the UI](app-dev-process.md#design).

![Setting the application configuration](./media/tizen_project_explorer_w.png)

You can [edit the application properties using the form tabs of the Web application configuration editor](../../../tizen-studio/web-tools/config-editor.md#edit).

<a name="overview"></a>
### Defining and Editing General Information in the Overview Tab

You can define and edit general information about the application in the **Overview** tab of the Web application configuration editor.

You can perform the following tasks using the **Overview** tab:

-   View the application identifier.

    Tizen Studio creates automatically an application ID, which uniquely identifies the application within the package.

-   Set the content.

    The content represents the start-up file of the Web application.

-   Set the application name.

    The application name is displayed in an application menu or in other contexts.

-   Set the version.

    The format of the current application version is "x.y.z".

-   Add an application icon.

    You can add a launcher icon to your application by defining it in the **Icon** panel.

    The following table describes the available icon format and size.

    **Table: Icon format and size**

    | Format | Size [Xhigh (HD)]  |  
    |------|-----------------|  
    | 32-bit PNG with alpha | 117 x 117 pixels  |

-   Define the application author, license, and description in the **Managing the Application** section:
    -   **Author** field represents the person or organization that created the Web application.
    -   **E-mail** field represents the email address of the author.
    -   **Web Site** field represents the IRI associated with the Web application, such as a homepage or a profile on a social network.
    -   **License** field represents the software license, which can include content, such as a usage agreement, redistribution statement, and copyright license terms, under which the content of the Web application package is provided.
    -   **License URL** field represents the valid IRI or path associated with the software or content license.
    -   **Description** field represents the human-readable description of the Tizen Web application package.

-   Define the UI preferences of the application in the **Managing the Application UI** section:
    -   **Width** field represents the start-up file viewport width.
    -   **Height** field represents the start-up file viewport height.
    -   **View Modes** field represents the preferred view mode
(maximized fullscreen).

<a name="feature"></a>
### Declaring Required Software or Hardware Features in the Features Tab

You can declare any device software or hardware features that your application requires to run properly. The declaration can be used for application filtering in Tizen Store.

To enable filtering for your Web application:

1.  In the **Features** tab, click **+**.
2.  Select the needed features from the [predefined list of features available for filtering](../app-filtering.md).
3.  Click **Finish**.
4.  Upload and publish the application package on Tizen Store.

    If a Tizen-powered device requests applications, the store displays a list containing only applications compatible with the user's device.

After saving the feature information with the Web application configuration editor, you can see the added code in the **Source** tab:
```xml
<feature name="http://tizen.org/feature/network.nfc"/>
```

<a name="privilege"></a>
### Specifying Privileges in the Privileges Tab

You can use features and services provided by privileged APIs, which handle platform and user-sensitive data. You can specify an API, or API groups, accessed and used by the Web application in the **Privileges** tab of the Web application configuration editor. The tab serves as a standardized tool to request the binding of an IRI-identifiable runtime component for a Web application to use at runtime.

To add a privilege:

1.  In the **Privileges** tab, click **+**.
2.  In the **Add privilege** window, select an option:
    -   **Internal**: Select the needed privileges from the [predefined list of API privileges](../sec-privileges.md).
    -   **Privilege name**: Manually enter the URL containing a privilege definition.
    -   **File**: Click **Browse** and select a privilege file (with the `.xml` or `.widlprocxml` extension).

3.  Click **Finish**.

After saving the privilege information with the Web application configuration editor, you can see the added code in the **Source** tab:
```xml
<tizen:privilege name="http://tizen.org/privilege/application.launch"/>
```

<a name="policy"></a>
### Defining External Access Policies in the Policy Tab

According to the W3C Access Requests Policy (WARP), you cannot access external network resources by default. If you require access to an external network resource, you must request network resource permissions for the Web application using the **Policy** tab of the Web application configuration editor.

The following table lists the policy properties you can edit in the **Policy** tab.

**Table: Policy information**

       Apache License, Version 2.0
    </license>
    ```

You can localize a Web application to adapt to various languages and cultural environments by creating different Web application versions for different languages. For more information, see [Localizing Web Applications](../../../tizen-studio/web-tools/web-localization.md).

<a name="preferences"></a>
### Declaring Name-value Pairs in the Preferences Tab

You can declare name-value pairs which can be set and retrieved using the Widget Interface API (in [mobile](../../api/latest/w3c_api/w3c_api_m.html#widget), [wearable](../../api/latest/w3c_api/w3c_api_w.html#widget), and [TV](../../api/latest/w3c_api/w3c_api_tv.html#widget) applications) in the **Preferences** tab of the Web application configuration editor. These name-value pairs, or preferences, are used by the Web application during execution.


To add preferences, click **+**. A new row appears in the table. Enter values in the **Name** and **Value** columns. You can set a preference as read-only by setting the **Read-only** column value as **true**.

After saving the preference information with the Web application configuration editor, you can see the added code in the **Source** tab:  
```xml
<preference name="key" value="value" readonly="false"/>

### Editing the config.xml File in the Source Tab

The **Source** tab of the Web application configuration editor shows the code of the `config.xml` file. You can [edit the basic syntax of the XML document](../../../tizen-studio/web-tools/config-editor.md) and also see how changes made on the other tabs are reflected in the raw XML source content.

> **Note**  
> The `config.xml` must conform not only to the XML file format
but also to the W3C specification requirements. If you edit application information manually in the `config.xml` file source code, you can introduce errors preventing the application from running normally.
