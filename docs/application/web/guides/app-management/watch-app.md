# Watch Application

You can easily create a watch face application for a wearable device by taking advantage of the Watch samples delivered with the Tizen Studio. The Canvas Watch is a fully functional application that displays an analog clock on a canvas, and you can use it as a basis for your watch face application.

This feature is supported in wearable applications only.

To build a watch face application, you must follow these general steps:

1. Before you get started with developing Tizen applications, download and install the [Tizen Studio](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-studio/download).

   For more information on the installation process, see the [installation guide](../../../tizen-studio/setup/install-sdk.md).

2. [Create a wearable Web watch project](../../getting-started/wearable-watch/first-app-watch.md#create) using the Tizen Studio.

   This step shows how you can use a predesigned project template that creates all the basic files and folders required for your project.

3. [Build the application](../../getting-started/wearable-watch/first-app-watch.md#build).

   After you have implemented code for the features you want, this step shows how you can build the application to validate and compile the code.

4. [Run the application](../../getting-started/wearable-watch/first-app-watch.md#run).

   This step shows how you can run the application on the emulator or a real target device.

5. [Design a UI](../../getting-started/wearable-watch/first-app-watch.md#ui).

   This step shows how you can create the application UI and make small alterations to it to improve the usability of your application.


Creating Your First Tizen Wearable Web Watch Application [Create a wearable Web watch project](../../getting-started/wearable-watch/first-app-watch.md) describes the main steps required to develop a watch face application using the Tizen Studio. For more detailed information about the application development process, see [Web Application Development Process](../../tutorials/app-dev-process.md). To learn how to design a watch face, see the Gear UI guides on the [Samsung Developers](http://developer.samsung.com/technical-doc/list.do) site.
