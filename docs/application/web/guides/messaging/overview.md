# Messaging

The messaging features introduce how you can use email, SMS, and MMS messaging in your application. You can also register your application to use the push service.

You can use the following messaging features in your Web applications:

- [Messages](./messages.md) **in mobile applications only**

  You can create, send, and read text, multimedia, and email messages. You can also manage messages in the message storage, and handle a situation where the device has multiple SIM cards and you need to determine which SIM card is used to send the text messages.

- [Push Notification](./push.md)

  The application can receive push notifications from a push server. You can register your application and connect to the push service, to be ready to receive push notifications when they arrive.
