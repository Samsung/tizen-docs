# Machine learning

Machine Learning features help you to handle Neural Network Frameworks (NNFWs), like [TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite](https://tensorflow.org).

You can use the following machine learning features in your Web applications:

- [Tensors Management](./tensors.md)

  You can create and manage `TensorsInfo` and `TensorsData` objects, which allow you to exchange data with neural models.

- [Single](./single.md)

  You can use the SingleShot API for a simple scenario of neural network models. The SingleShot API allows you to invoke a neural network model with a single instance of input data for the model directly.

- [Pipeline](./pipeline.md)

  You can use the Pipeline API for an advanced scenario of neural network models. The Pipeline API allows you to create inference pipelines with multiple neural network models.
