- **Designing for multiple screens**

  Tizen supports various device types with several different screen sizes.To provide an optimal user experience, it is important to design your application to support different screen sizes. In addition to different devices, you must also consider system configuration changes, such as the default home screen layout and system fonts after OS upgrades, since they can change the size of the viewable content screen. Such changes affect the application layout, and can lead to an undesirable UI design layout. Use the following topics to design your application to be highly flexible and adaptive against these possibilities.

    Enables you to define the font-face and font-family, to avoid layout incompatibility due to the default system font changes after OS upgrades.

  - [Multiple Screen Support](./multiple-screens.md) **in mobile applications only**

    Allows you to create an application that is both scalable and adaptive to multiple screen resolutions.

  - [Multiple UI Layouts](./ui-layout.md) **in wearable applications only**
