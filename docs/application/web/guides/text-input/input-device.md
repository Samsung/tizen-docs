# Input Device

You can manage input device keys.

This feature is supported in mobile and wearable applications only.

The main features of the Input Device API include:

- Gathering a list of supported keys   

  You can [get a list of all supported keys](#getting-a-list-of-all-supported-keys) and perform actions for the list.

- Getting key information by its name   

  You can [gather the key code based on the key name](#gathering-key-information).

- Registering and deregistering key events   

  You can [register keys](#registering-and-deregistering-keys) to handle DOM events for them.

The key names are listed in the [DOM Level 3 KeyboardEvent key Values](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-key-20140612) specification. The `name` attribute in the Input Device API is equal to the key value specified in the specification (the [Media Controller Keys](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-key-20140612/#keys-media-controller) section is the most relevant to the Input Device API). If the specification does not contain an appropriate entry for the key, the Input Device API provides a device-specific `name`.

## Getting a List of All Supported Keys

To get a list of all supported keys:

1. To get a supported key list, use the `getSupportedKeys()` method of the `InputDeviceManager` interface (in [mobile](../../api/latest/device_api/mobile/tizen/inputdevice.html#InputDeviceManager) and [wearable](../../api/latest/device_api/wearable/tizen/inputdevice.html#InputDeviceManager) applications):

   ```
   var keyCodes = {};
   var supportedKeys = tizen.inputdevice.getSupportedKeys();

   console.log('Supported keys list');
   for (var i = 0; i < supportedKeys.length; ++i) {
       keyCodes[supportedKeys[i].name] = supportedKeys[i].code;
       console.log(i + ': ' + supportedKeys[i].name + ' - ' + supportedKeys[i].code);
   }
   ```

2. Use the gathered list to handle `keydown` and `keyup` events.

## Gathering Key Information

To gather information about the key by its name:

1. Create a list of keys for which you want the information by using the `InputDeviceKey` object (in [mobile](../../api/latest/device_api/mobile/tizen/inputdevice.html#InputDeviceKey) and [wearable](../../api/latest/device_api/wearable/tizen/inputdevice.html#InputDeviceKey) applications).

   If you do not want to gather information about all supported keys, create a separate list of keys for information gathering. If you want information about all supported keys, use the list retrieved in the previous use case.

   ```
   var keys = ['VolumeUp', 'VolumeDown'];
   var keyCodes = {};
   ```

2. Check each key separately using the `getKey()` method of the `InputDeviceManager` interface (in [mobile](../../api/latest/device_api/mobile/tizen/inputdevice.html#InputDeviceManager) and [wearable](../../api/latest/device_api/wearable/tizen/inputdevice.html#InputDeviceManager) applications).

   If the result of the `getKey()` method is not `null`, you can access the key information. If the result is `null`, the key is not supported.

   ```
   for (var i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {
       try {
           var key = tizen.inputdevice.getKey(keys[i]);
           if (key == null) {
               console.log('key: ' + keys[i] + ' is not supported');
           } else {
               keyCodes[key.name] = key.code;
               console.log('key: ' + key.name + ' has code: ' + key.code);
           }
       } catch (e) {
           console.log('error: ' + e.name + ':' + e.message + ', when getting key with name ' + keys[i]);
       }
   }
   ```

## Registering and Deregistering Keys

When you want to react to input device key presses, register the applicable key using the `InputDeviceManager` interface (in [mobile](../../api/latest/device_api/mobile/tizen/inputdevice.html#InputDeviceManager) and [wearable](../../api/latest/device_api/wearable/tizen/inputdevice.html#InputDeviceManager) applications). After registering the input device key, the application receives a DOM keyboard event when the key is pressed or released. When the events are no longer needed, deregister the key.

> **Note**  
> The application cannot register the mandatory keys (**ArrowLeft**, **ArrowRight**, **ArrowUp**, **ArrowDown**, **Enter**, and **Back**).

To manage input device keys, you must learn to change the action of a supported key:

1. To gather the keys, [get a list of all supported keys](#getting-a-list-of-all-supported-keys).

2. To register all supported keys for handling `keydown` and `keyup` events:

   ```
   var codeNamesMap = {};
   var supportedKeys = tizen.inputdevice.getSupportedKeys();

   for (var i = 0; i < supportedKeys.length; ++i) {
       try {
           tizen.inputdevice.registerKey(supportedKeys[i].name);
           codeNamesMap[supportedKeys[i].code] = supportedKeys[i].name;
           console.log('key: ' + supportedKeys[i].name + ' was registered for event handling');
       } catch (error) {
           console.log('failed to register ' + supportedKeys[i].name + ': ' + error);
       }
   }
   ```

   If you know the exact list of keys you want to register, the registration can also be done with the asynchronous `registerKeyBatch()` method:

   ```
   var keys = ['VolumeUp', 'VolumeDown'];

   function errorCB(err) {
       console.log('The following error occurred: ' + err.name);
   }

   function successCB() {
       console.log('All keys registered successfully');
   }

   tizen.inputdevice.registerKeyBatch(keys, successCB, errorCB);
   ```

3. To handle events for registered keys:

   ```
   window.addEventListener('keydown', function(keyEvent) {
       if (codeNamesMap.hasOwnProperty(keyEvent.keyCode)) {
           console.log('Registered key was pressed');
           /* Define some custom action */
       } else {
           console.log('Some other key was pressed');
       }
   });

   window.addEventListener('keyup', function(keyEvent) {
       if (codeNamesMap.hasOwnProperty(keyEvent.keyCode)) {
           console.log('Registered key was released');
           /* Define some custom action */
       } else {
           console.log('Some other key was released');
       }
   });
   ```

4. When custom actions are no longer needed, deregister the keys:

   ```
   for (var i = 0; i < supportedKeys.length; ++i) {
       tizen.inputdevice.unregisterKey(supportedKeys[i].name);
       console.log('key: ' + supportedKeys[i].name + ' was unregistered for event handling');
   }
   ```

   The deregistration can also be done with the `unregisterKeyBatch()` method:

   ```
   var keys = ['VolumeUp', 'VolumeDown'];

   function errorCB(err) {
       console.log('The following error occurred: ' + err.name);
   }

   function successCB() {
       console.log('Unregistered successfully');
   }

   tizen.inputdevice.unregisterKeyBatch(keys, successCB, errorCB);
   ```

   After deregistration, the `keydown` and `keyup` events are no longer triggered for the keys.
