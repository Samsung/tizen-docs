# Text Input

The text input feature introduces how you can provide customized keyboards. You can also define keyboard commands to trigger specific actions.

You can use the following text input feature in your Web applications:

  You can implement IME (Input Method Editor) applications to provide IME support for client applications. You can handle various editing tasks, manage hardware key events, and display event notifications on the screen.

- [Input Device](./input-device.md) **in mobile and wearable applications only**

  You can manage input keys in the application. You can retrieve information about the available keys, and add custom actions to be performed when specific input keys are pressed.
