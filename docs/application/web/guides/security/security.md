# Security

The security features introduce how you can store and recall data, and communicate with other applications in a secure manner in your application.

You can use the following security features in your Web applications:

- [Secure Key Management](secure-key.md)

  You can provide a secure repository for keys, certificates, and sensitive data related to users and their password-protected applications. You can also use secure cryptographic operations for non-exportable keys without revealing the key values to clients.

- [TEE Communication](tee-client.md)

  You can create secure communications by executing your application in a trusted execution environment (TEE), and communicating with other applications within that environment.

- [Privacy-related Permissions](privacy-related-permissions.md)

  You can check current permissions for privacy-related privileges and request user permission to use specified privileges.
