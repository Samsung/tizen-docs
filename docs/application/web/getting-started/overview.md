# Getting Started with Web Applications

When creating your first Tizen Web application, you can select from the
following options, which all use the Web-native languages, such as
HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript:

-   [Mobile Web application](mobile/first-app.md)

    A mobile application is targeted to run on smart phones, and can
    take advantage of a wide variety of functionalities available on
    those devices.

-   [Wearable Web application](wearable/first-app.md)

    A wearable application is targeted to run on smart watches, and can
    be optimized for the smaller screen.

-   [Wearable Web watch
    application](wearable-watch/first-app-watch.md)

    A wearable watch application is a customized watch face that can be
    shown as the device home screen.

-   [Wearable Web widget
    application](wearable-widget/first-app-widget.md)

    A wearable widget application is a small application that can be
    shown by specific UI applications (such as the home screen).

-   [TV Web application](tv/first-app.md)

    A TV application is targeted to run on smart TVs, and can be optimized for larger screens and remote control.

The first application examples show a simple application with a basic UI
and minimal functionality. Get familiar with the example first, and
afterwards you can use it as a basis to build more complex applications.
