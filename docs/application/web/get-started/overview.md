# Get Started with Web Applications

You can create the Tizen Web applications that consist of languages such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. 
You can also use the Tizen Web APIs that interact with the Tizen native subsystems.

To create your first Tizen Web application, you can select from the following profiles:

-   [Wearable Web application](wearable/first-app.md)

    An application that is targeted to run on smartwatches. It can be optimized for small screens.

-   [Wearable Web watch application](wearable-watch/first-app-watch.md)

    An application that is a customized watch face and can be shown on the device home screen.

-   [Wearable Web widget application](wearable-widget/first-app-widget.md)

    An application that can be shown by specific UI applications such as home screen.

-   [TV Web application](tv/first-app.md)

    An application that is targeted to run on smart TVs. It can be optimized for large screens and remote controls.

-   [Samsung Smart TV Web application](tv/first-samsung-tv-app.md)

    A TV application is targeted to run on Samsung smart TVs, and can be optimized for larger screens and remote control.

-   [Mobile Web application](mobile/first-app.md)

    An application that is targeted to run on smartphones. It can take advantage of the functionalities available on smartphones.

The examples in each profile explain a simple application with a basic UI and minimal functionality.
Get familiar with these examples, and then you can build more complex applications.

## Background service on a Web application

A Web service application is an application that consists of a Javascript file that implements the callbacks handling application life-cycle in the background. The service runs in another sandboxing context separated from the current Web application.

-   [Web Service Application](web-service/first-service.md)

    A service is an application that runs some business logic in the background based on Node.js runtime.

The first service example will show you a simple service life-cycle management before entering the main page of a Web application you want to run. Get familiar with the example first, and then you can use it as a base to build more complicated services.

## Richness on your Web applications

After you create your first Tizen Web application, you can create additional common functionalities, which work on all your Web applications. To create them, you can use languages, such as HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

-   [Web Application Addon](addon/first-addon.md)

    Addon is a software program that commonly runs on the Web applications.

The first addon example shows a pop-up saying hello before you enter to the main page of a Web application that you want to run. First, get familiar with the example and afterwards you can use it as a base to build more complex addons.
