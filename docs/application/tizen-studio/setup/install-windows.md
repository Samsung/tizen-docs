  </tr>
</table>

### Hardware Prerequisites
Ensure that the target system meets the following hardware requirements: 
<table>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="4">Hardware </th>
    <th>CPU</th>
    <th colspan="3">Dual Core, 2Ghz or faster</th>

> **Note:**
>
> - Download the relevant version based on target device operating system, for example, **openjdk-10_windows-x64_bin.tar.gz**. 
> - Ensure you download the JavaFX <OS> SDK product only, for example: JavaFX Windows SDK.
> - Alternatively, you can also try using Oracle JDK 10 or less instead of OpenJDK, see the official site for the installation steps.

## Setup OpenJDK in Windows

Following are the steps to setup OpenJDK: 

1. Extract the downloaded **openjdk-10_windows-x64_bin.tar.gz**, and **openjfx-11.0.2_windows-x64_bin-sdk.zip** files.
   - Locate **jdk-10** and **javafx-sdk-11.0.2** directories.
   > **Note:**
   >
   >  jdk-10, javafx-sdk-11.0.2 directories get created as a result of extraction. 
   
2. Navigate to the **lib** folder in the **javafx-sdk-11.0.2** directory and copy all the files except src.zip.
3. Navigate to the **lib** folder in the **jdk-10** directory and paste all the copied files.
4. Navigate to the **bin** folder in the **javafx-sdk-11.0.2** directory and copy all the files.
5. Go to the **bin** folder in the **jdk-10** directory and paste all the copied files.

Following steps help you to set up the JDK path:

1.	Navigate to **Start > Control Panel > System and security > System**.
2.	Click **Advanced system settings**.
	   - The System Properties window is displayed.

	a. Enter the following details: 
	 
	 - Variable name: JAVA_HOME 
	 - Variable value: C:\Path\to\your\openJDKtype, i.e, browse for JDK directory path (for example, C:\Users\user\Desktop\jdk-10.0.2) 
		
5.	Click **OK**. The Environment Variable list is updated with JAVA_HOME variable.
6.	Under the System variables section, click **New**.
	
	> **Note:**
    >
    >  If your Path variable is already created, select it and click Edit.
	
7.	Enter the following details: 
	- Variable name: Path 
	- Variable value:C:\Path \to\ openJDK\bin directory, i.e, browse for bin subdirectory path in JDK directory  (for example, C:\Users\user\Desktop\jdk-10.0.2\bin ) 
	
8.	Click **OK**. The System Variable list is updated with **Path** variable.
9.	Save and close the Environment Variables window.
10.	Open Command Prompt and type the following command to verify whether the OpenJDK version 10 is installed:
