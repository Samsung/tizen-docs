The Tizen Studio is a comprehensive set of tools for developing Tizen native and Web applications. It consists of an IDE, emulator, toolchain, sample code, and documentation. Tizen Studio runs on WindowsÂ® and Ubuntu, as well as macOS. Tizen applications can be developed without relying on the official Tizen Studio, as long as the application complies with the Tizen packaging rules.

For installation instructions, see [Installing Tizen Studio](installing-sdk.md). For more information, see [Release Notes](../release-notes/2-2-release-notes.md).
