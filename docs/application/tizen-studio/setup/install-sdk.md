# Installing Tizen Studio

The installer has been renewed to provide a better user experience and show the unique Tizen philosophy. Using the new installer, you can now install the basic platform and the useful tools with a few clicks.

You can use either the GUI or the CLI version of the installer.

## Using the GUI Installer

To install Tizen Studio:

1. Launch the Tizen Studio installer.

2. Accept the software license.

   The license contains important legal notices for using Tizen Studio. Read it fully, and click **Accept** only if you agree with the license statement:

   ![Tizen Studio License Agreement](./media/install_sdk_license.png)

3. Click the **...** button and specify a new directory to set the SDK and data location. If the new directory is valid and shows no errors, click **Install**:

   ![Set SDK and data location](./media/install_sdk_directory.png)

4. Click **Install** to install the required packages and tools in the specified directory.

   You can monitor the installation process or cancel the installation. The installation process is completed in a few minutes, unless you cancel it.

5. Click **Finish** and close the installer:


   ![Installation complete](./media/migration_finish_instal.png)

   If you want to install additional platforms and tools, launch the Package Manager by checking the **Launch the Package Manager** check box and click **Finish**.

   Using the Tizen Studio Package Manager, you can install and update additional tools. For more information on the Package Manager, see [Updating Tizen Studio](./update-sdk.md).


   > **Note**
   >
   > If you install Tizen Studio in a directory that requires administrator privileges for access, such as `C:\Program Files`, administrator privileges are required to run the Tizen SDK tools.


## Using the CLI Installer

The CLI (command line interface) provides functional tools for running the CLI installer without the GUI environment.

To install Tizen Studio using the CLI installer:

1. [Download the appropriate CLI installer for your platform](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-studio/download).

2. Run the CLI installer:

   - On Microsoft Windows&reg;, the command prompt opens and the installer is automatically executed.
   - On Ubuntu and macOS, open the terminal, go to the directory where the installer is downloaded, and enter the `chmod +x` command to apply the execute permission to the installer file. Then, execute the installer by entering the command with the following syntax:

   ```
   web-cli_Tizen_Studio_<version> [options] [<directory path>]
   ```

   **Table: Install options**

   | Option             | Description                              |
   |--------------------|------------------------------------------|
   | `--show-license`   | Displays the Tizen Studio software license agreement.<br/> You must use this option alone. Do not use with other options. |
   | `--accept-license` | Accepts the license terms.               |
   | `--no-java-check`  | Skips the Java version check.            |

   **Table: Install command parameters**

   | Parameter        | Description                              |
   |------------------|------------------------------------------|
   | `directory path` | Specifies the installation directory path.<br/> If you do not enter the path, Tizen Studio is installed in the default directory (`/home/{user}/tizen-studio`). |

3. If you agree to the software license and the license terms, enter **Y(yes)** for the conditions.

4. Enter the Tizen Studio installation location.

   The CLI installer begins to install the Web App Development platform and tools on your computer.

> If you want to develop a native application on the CLI, you must install the Native App Development platform and tools using the CLI Package Manager.

## Installing Additional Packages with CLI

```
package-manager-cli install [--accept-license] [--no-java-check] [--proxy <value>] [-f <file path>] [-p <password>] <package name>[,...]
```
