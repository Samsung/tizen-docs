## GUI Uninstaller

With an intuitive interface, the GUI uninstaller simplifies the uninstallation process. You can easily uninstall Tizen Studio and the related platforms and packages. 

To uninstall Tizen Studio using GUI uninstaller, follow these steps:

1. Back up all the data and the files in case you want to keep them for future reference. 
   > **Note**
   >
   > Once you start the uninstallation process, the process is irreversible. You cannot restore the removed files.
2. Launch Tizen Studio uninstaller, click the **uninstaller icon.**
3. Check the following section to make a choice of components that you want to uninstall. 

   - **SDK data**  
   The SDK data directory typically contains user-created data files, including emulator images, log files, and tool configuration files.

   - **KeyStore**  
   The keystore directory is located inside the SDK data directory and contains the author and distributor certificate files. If the certificate files are deleted, you cannot restore them from any Tizen seller market site. If you plan to install another Tizen Studio version or reinstall Tizen Studio later, it is strongly recommended that you back up the certificate files or keep the keystore directory by unchecking the **KeyStore** component.

     > **Note**  
     > 
     > If you do not select SDK data or KeyStore components, you can keep the SDK data or KeyStore files in their directories for future        re-use.

4. To remove all the installed platforms, packages, tools, and the user-created data and the files, click **Uninstall**.
