# Building Unit Test Projects

With unit tests, you can verify that your code works well and increase its reliability. The Tizen Studio provides the creating, building, and editing tools for unit tests, and a view for checking and analyzing the test results.

The Tizen Studio uses the gtest framework to make and launch test cases. To manage your test cases, you can use the **Test Explorer** view.

## Creating a Unit Test Project

You can create a test project for the Tizen native project through the Tizen Native Unit Test Project wizard. The wizard provides the test project for each Tizen native project type, such as UI application, service application, shared library, and static library.

To create a test project:

1. In the Tizen Studio menu, select **File > New > Other > Tizen > Tizen Native Unit Test Project**.

2. In the New Tizen Unit Test Project window:

   1. In the **Select the Tizen Project for test** panel, select the project you want to test.
   2. Specify a name for the test project.
   3. Specify a destination folder where to save the project.
   4. Click **Finish**.

To use the test project:

1. In the **Project Explorer** view, open the `<TEST_PROJECT_HOME>/src/<TEST_PROJECT_NAME>TestCase.cpp` file.

2. Add a `TEST_F()` test case.

   Each `TEST_F()` test case is independent. If the `TEST_F()` test case is associated with a fixture class name, the test case runs based on that fixture class.

3. Add assertions.

   The unit test tool supports basic assertions, binary comparison, and string comparison in the gtest. For more information, see [Google Test Advanced Guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/advanced.md).

To test the project written in the C code, a unit test project for the C++ language is provided. In this case, the tested function must be qualified as an extern "C" to avoid the 'undefined reference' error as demangled symbols in the error message.

There are 2 forms of the extern "C" declaration:

- Declare the extern "C" linkage specification in the C header file:

  ```csharp
  #ifdef __cplusplus
  extern "C"
  {
      #endif
      int foo;
      void bar();

      #ifdef __cplusplus
  }
  #endif
  ```

- Include the C headers in the C++ code:

  ```csharp
  extern "C"
  {
      #include "header.h"
  }
  ```

In the following example with a calculator sample project, a test case is created for the `utils_round()` function declared in the `utils/utils.h` header file:

1. Create a calculator project named **myProject**, and for it a unit test project named **myProjectTest**.
2. Append the test method to the end of the `myProjectTest/src/myProjectTestTestCase.cpp` file:  
```csharp
TEST_F(TestSuite, utils_round)
{
    double var = 3.5;
    /* long long utils_round(double value); */
    EXPECT_EQ(utils_round(var), (long long)4);
}
```
3. Change the line that includes the `utils/utils.h` file:  
```csharp
#include "view/window.h"
#include "view/main-view.h"
extern "C"
{
    #include "utils/utils.h"
}
#include "utils/ui-utils.h"
```

## Running the Unit Test Project on Devices

To launch the unit test project, click the **Run** icon in the toolbar.

**Figure: Launching the test project**

![Launching the test project](./media/unit_test_launch.png)

After the test cases are executed, the results are displayed on both the **Test Result** and **Test Explorer** views.

### Customizing the Launch Configuration

The test case running can be customized with launch options. To set the launch options:

1. In the **Project Explorer** view, right-click the project.
2. Select **Run > Run Configurations or Run > Debug Configurations**.
3. Select **Tizen Native Unit Test**, and click **New**.

The name of the test project is displayed in the **Configurations** dialog box. You can control specific launch options in the **Advanced** tab:

- **Run Disabled Tests**: If selected, the disabled test cases are also run.
- **Shuffle Tests**: If selected, test cases are run in a random order.
- **Generate an XML Report**: If selected, a test result XML file is generated.

## Managing Test Cases in the Test Explorer

On the **Test Explorer** view, you can launch the test cases, and check the results. If you want to open the **Test Explorer** view or update the test cases, right-click the unit test project in the **Project Explorer**, and select **Show in Test Explorer**.

When the test cases are executed, the test case states are automatically updated.

**Table: Test case states**

| Icon                                     | Description                              |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| ![Start icon](./media/unit_test_icon_start.png) Starting state | When you open the view for the first time, all nodes have this status, except the disabled tests. |
| ![Disabled icon](./media/unit_test_icon_disabled.png) Test is disabled | Disabled nodes are not run.              |
| ![Success icon](./media/unit_test_icon_success.png) Test has been successfully run | Test suites have this status when all their test cases have been successfully run. |
| ![Abnormal icon](./media/unit_test_icon_abnormal.png) Abnormal test suite status | ![Terminated icon](./media/unit_test_icon_terminated.png) Test was not fully performed, because it was abnormally terminated.</br>![Killed icon](./media/unit_test_icon_killed.png) Test was killed by the system, because it exceeded the specified time. |

The **Test Explorer** view provides the following options for testing and test cases:

- **Refresh Tree**: refreshes the test case tree to reflect the linked unit test project's changes.
- **Expand All** and **Collapse All**: expands or collapses the test case tree.
- **Check All** and **Clear All**: checks or unchecks all the check boxes in the tree.
- **Check Failed**: checks failed test cases only.
- **Run Checked**: runs checked test cases.
- **Run Disabled Tests**: if selected, runs also the disabled test cases.
- **Shuffle Tests**: if selected, runs test cases in a random order.
- **Generate an XML Report**: if selected, generates a test result XML file.

The **Run Disabled Tests**, **Shuffle Tests**, and **Generate an XML Report** options can be altered in the **Advanced** tab of the [launch configuration](#running-the-unit-test-project-on-devices).
