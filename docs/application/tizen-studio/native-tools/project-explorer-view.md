# Managing Tizen Projects with Project Explorer View

The **Project Explorer** view allows you to view and manage Tizen projects. You can view and change the resources of a project in the view, and build, export, and convert projects through the view.

In this view, you can:

- Browse the file elements
- Open files in the editor view
- Open projects in a new window
- Create new projects, classes, files, or folders
- Manage existing files (cut, paste, delete, move, or rename files)
- Restore deleted files from local history
- Import or export files and projects

## Opening the Project Explorer View

Usually, the **Project Explorer** view is located in the upper-left side of the Tizen Studio. You can change the position by dragging and dropping it. If you close the view, you can show it again by selecting **Project Explorer** in **Window > Show View > Other > General**.

## Using the Project Explorer View

The files that you select in the **Project Explorer** view affect the information that is displayed in the other views. You can execute and set some operations and configurations by clicking the icons (![Toolbar icons](./media/proj_explorer_op_config.png)) in the toolbar.

To execute operations, such as copying, moving, creating new resources, and comparing resources with each other, right-click on any resource in the **Project Explorer** view, and select the desired action in the context menu. The items in the context menu depend on the focused item. Different folder and file types have different action options.

**Table: Project Explorer context menu**

| Menu                      | Description                              |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **New**                   | Allows you to create a new resource in the workbench. Select the type of resource to create from the submenu. |
| **Delete**                | Deletes the selected resource from the workspace. |
| **Move**                  | Moves the selected resource to another location. A dialog appears, prompting for the destination location to which the resource are to be moved. |
| **Rename**                | Allows you to specify a new name for the selected resource. |
| **Export to CLI project** | Exports the Tizen Studio native project to a CLI (command line interface) project. This option also makes or converts some files. |
| **Build Signed Package**  | Makes a 'signed' package. This option requires a certificate profile. You can create a certificate profile in **Tools > Certificate Manager**. |
| **Localization**          | Opens the localization view and allows you to add or update languages and localize the string or resources. |
| **Refresh**               | Refreshes the **Workbench** view of the selected resource and its children. For example, this is used when you create a new file for an existing project outside the **Workbench** and want the file to appear in the **Project Explorer** view. |
| **Open Project**          | Opens the selected project (visible when a closed project is selected). |
| **Close Project**         | Closes the selected project (visible when an open project is selected). |
| **Team**                  | Menu items in the **Team** sub-menu are related to version control management and are determined by the version control management system that is associated with the project. Eclipse provides the special menu item **Share Project...** for projects that are not under version control management. This command presents a wizard that allows you to share the project with any version control management systems that have been added to Eclipse. Eclipse ships with support for CVS. |
| **Properties**            | Displays the properties of the selected resource. The displayed properties depend on what type of resource is selected. Resource properties can include (but are not limited to):</br> - Path relative to the project in which it is held </br> - Type of the resource </br> - Absolute file system path, or name of the path variable when using linked resources </br> - Resolved path variable when using a path variable for a linked resource </br> - Size of the resource </br> - Last modified date </br> - Read-only status </br> - Derived resource status </br> - Execution arguments, if it is an executable resource </br> - Program launchers, if it is able to be launched </br> - Project dependencies, if any |
