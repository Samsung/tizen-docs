# Creating Tizen Projects with Tizen Project Wizard

The Tizen Project Wizard is a Tizen Studio tool that is used to create a native application project.

The Tizen Studio provides various project templates and samples that make it easier for you to start coding your application. When you create a new project, you can select a specific template, which the Tizen Project Wizard uses to automatically create basic functionalities for the application. The default project files and folders are also created.

In the Tizen Project Wizard, you can select a profile and version, application type, and template or sample to create the project. In addition, you can set basic project properties, such as the project name, location, and working sets.

To open the Tizen Project Wizard, use one of the following:

- In the Tizen Studio menu, select **File > New > Tizen Project**.
- In the Tizen Studio toolbar, click the **New** icon (![New icon](./media/project_wizard_icon_new.png)).
- Right-click in the **Project Explorer** view, and select **New > Tizen Project**.
- If there is no project in the workspace, click the **New** icon (![New icon](./media/project_wizard_icon_new.png)) in the **Project Explorer** view toolbar.

The Tizen Studio provides various project templates and samples for mobile and wearable devices according to the installed platform. The Tizen Project Wizard helps you select a template or sample for your project.

The **Template** option provides a list of templates with a basic structure where you can start the native application project:

- **Common**
  - **Basic UI/Basic UI with EDC**: Empty template projects for developing UI applications using EFL.
  - **Basic UI with DALi**: Empty template project for developing 3D graphic applications using DALi (Dynamic Animation Library).
  - **Input Method Editor**: Simple template project for an IME application, which helps to create your own input method editor.
  - **Service**: Empty template project for developing applications with no graphical user interface that run in the background. They can be very useful in performing activities that need to run periodically or continuously, but do not require any user intervention, such as getting sensor data in the background.
  - **Shared Library/Static Library**: Empty template projects for developing libraries.
  - **Widget**: Empty template project for developing widget applications.

- **Mobile**
  - **Basic UI with Viewmgr**: Empty template project for developing UI applications with multiple views.
  - **Downloadable Font**: Empty template project for developing a downloadable font. You can create your own font resources in the Tizen Studio to be distributed as a downloadable font package.
  - **UI Builder - Navigation View/Single View**: Empty template projects for developing UI applications supported by the UI Builder, such as navigation or single view applications.

- **Wearable**
  - **UI Builder - Navigation View (Circle)/Single View (Circle)/Widget (Circle)**: Empty template projects for developing UI applications supported by the UI Builder, such as circular navigation view, circular single view, and circular widget applications.
  - **Watch/Watch Application with DALi**: Empty template projects for developing circular watch applications.

The **Sample** option provides a list of sample applications demonstrating various API usage and UI design.
