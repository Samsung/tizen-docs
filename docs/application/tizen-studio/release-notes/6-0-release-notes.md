### Known issues

  - On macOS, if the UI perspectives are not displayed properly after updating Tizen Studio, it is recommended to restart the IDE. This issue is because of the uncleared cache from the previous installation.
  - In case you see any old perspective, it is recommended to create a new workspace and import the projects to the new workspace to resolve the issue.
  - On macOS, from Catalina and above versions, Native Templates 5.5 will not build with CLI when the compiler is set to **GCC**.
- Common:
  - If you install Tizen Studio in a directory that requires administrator privileges for access, an alert will be shown. For example, for **C:\ProgramFiles**, location administrator privilege is needed to run Tizen SDK Tools. Tizen Installer and Baseline SDK Installer alerts you if you try to install it into such a directory.
  - On macOS, Tizen Studio will not work properly if it is installed on the desktop directory, that is **/HOME/Desktop**. However, it works properly if it is installed on any other directory.
- Web and Native IDE:
  - You can create Unit Tests for Tizen 2.3.2 and higher version projects only. Unit Testing for older versions is not supported.
- Web IDE:
  - The preview tab in the Web Page Editor sometimes does not appear properly. In this case, you can use an alternative feature, named Web SDK HTML Editor, which has enhanced features compared to the Web Page Editor. Instead of the preview tab in the Web Page Editor, use the preview feature **Ctrl+4** of the Web SDK HTML Editor.
  - In Rapid Development Support (RDS) mode, the Web Unit Test result is not updated.
  - Remote Inspector does not allow audit in the updated version of Chrome.
- Certificate Manager:
  - Overwriting a duplicate Certificate profile in the migration wizard does not work correctly on macOS.
- Emulator:
  - In Tizen 5.5 version, the uninstallation of Emulator images application might take some time to complete if the application name contains more than 14 characters. A patch for this is expected to be released in the next update.
  - To use Tizen Emulator, use Intel VTx supported CPU and the latest version of the graphics card driver provided by the vendor. To verify the prerequisites for Tizen Emulator, check [Prerequisites for Tizen Studio](../setup/prerequisites.md).
  - If the host machine is using NVIDIA&reg; Optimus&reg; technology on either Ubuntu or Windows, you must set Tizen Emulator to run with your NVIDIA&reg; graphics card. For Ubuntu, verify the [Bumblebee Project](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee){:target="_blank"}. For Windows, select **High Speed NVIDIA&reg; Processor** as **Preferred Graphics Processor** in the NVIDIA&reg; Control Panel.    
  - On Ubuntu, if the graphics driver is out-of-date while launching the Emulator Manager, your Ubuntu desktop session occasionally logs out, or the Emulator skin is not displayed properly. Verify the prerequisites and upgrade to the latest graphics driver.
  - On Windows, depending on your OS theme (such as, Non-Aero themes and Windows XP themes), a display surface can be erased for a while if the Emulator window is covered with another window. If you click on the Emulator window, the display surface runs correctly again.
  - On Windows, if an error with the message **"failed to allocate memory"** occurs while executing the Emulator, then try the following:
    - Close some of the other programs, and try to launch the Emulator again.
    - If the RAM size is set to 768 or 1024 MB for the VM in Emulator Manager, change it to 512 MB.
    - Increase the user area of the virtual memory in the system to 3 GB by entering the ``bcdedit/setincreaseuserva 3072`` command on the console with administrator rights (only on Windows 7), and then reboot.
  - If you use a MacBook Pro that has both Intel HD and NVIDIA&reg; GPUs, the Emulator can terminate unexpectedly when you execute the Emulator with OpenGL ES version 1.1 or 2.0. Verify the Emulator configuration in the Emulator Manager, and on the **General** tab in the Emulator configuration window, set OpenGL ES version to version 2.0, or to version 3.0.
  - When you launch Emulator Manager in Tizen IDE, the shortcut image of Emulator Manager may not be displayed properly.
  - Basic Web Applications are not installed on SD cards.
  - To use Tizen Emulator in Tizen Platform 3.0 or lower, disable the CPU VT option in the **HW Support** tab of the Emulator configuration.
- CLI and SDB:
  - Tizen Studio does not support the [Smart Development Bridge](../common-tools/smart-development-bridge.md) (SDB) bash auto-completion on Windows (it is available on Ubuntu and macOS).
  - SDB installation for RPK (Resource Package) is not supported in TV 8.0 Emulator and makes the SDB freeze, then press **Ctrl+C** to unfreeze (it will be supported in TV 9.0 Emulator).
- Dynamic Analyzer:
  - When analyzing applications (newly released or after a firmware update) on commercial devices that run on Tizen 3.0, the following problems exist:
    - The core frequency information is not shown.
    - The screenshots on the scene transitions feature does not work.
  - When analyzing applications on Tizen 4.0 Emulator or on reference device, the startup profiling information is not shown.
  - The UI Hierarchy viewer feature and startup profiling are not performed simultaneously.
  - The Dynamic Analyzer cannot show lifecycle information for Web Applications.
  - Widget Applications cannot be profiled with the Dynamic Analyzer. They are hidden in the application list on the toolbar for all Tizen Platforms, except for Tizen 2.3.2.
  - The Dynamic Analyzer sometimes gets stuck, which is caused by an internal security checking program.
- Visual Studio:
  - NUI XAML application build error can be resolved by doing a clean build.
