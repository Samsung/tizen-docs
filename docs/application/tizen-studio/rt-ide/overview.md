# Tizen RT

Tizen has commercialized in smart TV, smartphone, wearable devices (Gear S, Gear Fit), and smart home appliances. However, low-end and low-cost IoT devices, such as home appliances without display and wearable bands with a small LCD, have received less attention. The objective of Tizen RT is to extend the Tizen platform device coverage to these kind of low-end devices.

Tizen RT is an RTOS-based lightweight platform. The following are the hardware and environmental requirements:

- Hardware targets: 

  Cortex-M/R processors with MPU, less than 2 MB RAM, and less than 16 MB Flash.

- Development environment:
	- Tizen RT Studio for SmartThings:
	Tizen RT Studio version 2.0 (or later) is used as an IDE for developing IoT applications with the Tizen IoT Platform and ARTIK 053(s).

	- IoT Setup Wizard:
	The Tizen RT Setup Wizard is a computer application for easily setting up Tizen IoT on hardware targets. In the Tizen OS version 4.0, flashing a platform image into ARTIK 053(s) is only supported with the IoT Setup Wizard in a Linux computer environment.

To start developing your Tizen IoT applications:
1. [Install the Tizen Studio for RT](getting-started/install.md)
2. [Manage the project](getting-started/create.md)
3. [Managing SmartThings&trade; Certificates](smartthings-ext/certificate-smartthings.md)
4. [Flash the project](getting-started/flash.md)
5. [Use the serial terminal](getting-started/terminal.md)
6. [Debug the project](getting-started/debug.md)
