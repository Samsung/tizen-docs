# Managing SmartThings&trade; Certificates


SmartThings&trade; uses OpenSSL for security. To ensure that only trusted developers and manufactures can develop devices that communicate with the SmartThings Cloud, you must get certificates for devices to use the SmartThings&trade; service.

In the Tizen RT IDE, you can perform various certificate-related tasks, such as creation, removal, import, and activation, by using the **IoT Cloud Service** tab.

The Certificate Manager is launched automatically if no certificate is set as active when you try to flash a project. To launch the Certificate Manager manually, go to **Tools &gt; Certificate Manager** in the Tizen Studio for RT menu.

## Creating a Certificate 

The process of creating a new certificate requires you to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and submit it to the [Developer Workspace](https://devworkspace.developer.samsung.com/smartthingsconsole/iotweb/site/index.html#/main) Web site.

To create a new certificate to use the SmartThings&trade; service:

1. In the Tizen Certificate Manager, select IoT Cloud Service tab, and click ![plus](media/rt_plus.png).
