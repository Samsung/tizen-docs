# Managing Projects

The Tizen Studio provides the following set of tools to help you create and manage your Web application projects:

- [Project Creation Wizard](project-wizard.md) **(Creating Tizen Projects with Tizen Project Wizard)**

   The Project Wizard tool is used to create an application project. You can select from various project templates and samples that make it easier for you to start coding your application. When you create a new project with a specific template, the Project Wizard uses it to automatically create basic functionalities and default project files and folders for the application.

- [Project Explorer View](project-explorer-view.md) **(Managing Tizen Projects with Project Explorer View)**

   The **Project Explorer** view shows a hierarchical view of all project resources in the workspace. It allows you to manage Tizen projects, change the project resources, and build, export, and convert projects.

- [Certificate Registration](../common-tools/certificate-registration.md) **(Working with the Certificate Profile)**

   The Certificate Manager tool is used to create a certificate profile and register author and distributor certificates. Before installing your application on a device or submitting it to the Tizen Store, you must sign it with a certificate profile while packaging your application

- [Device Manager](../common-tools/device-manager.md) **(Monitoring Devices with the Device Manager)**

   The Device Manager tool is used to connect and manage devices on which you want to run your application. It also allows you to access the internal file systems and logs in the connected devices.
