# Debugging Your Application

   The **Log** view allows you to check the logs of your application based on the logging methods you have inserted to your code. It helps to debug your application by capturing all the events logged by the platform and your application.

  The Web Inspector tool allows you to debug your Web applications. It supports various features, such as viewing the Web page components, inspecting local and downloaded resources and the JavaScript source page, and performing advanced timing and speed analysis.

  The JavaScript Analyzer tool makes it easy to find problems in JavaScript code. It supports 2 analyzer types: a static analyzer to check the coding rules and a dynamic analyzer to check stale objects.
