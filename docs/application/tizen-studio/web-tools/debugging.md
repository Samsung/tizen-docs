# Debugging Your Application

The Tizen Studio provides the following set of tools to help you debug your Web application projects:

- [Log View](../common-tools/log-view.md) **(Checking Logs with Log View)**

   The **Log** view allows you to check the logs of your application based on the logging methods you have inserted to your code. It helps to debug your application by capturing all the events logged by the platform and your application.

- [Dynamic Analyzer](../common-tools/dynamic-analyzer/overview.md) **(Monitoring Performance with Dynamic Analyzer)**

   The Dynamic Analyzer tool monitors the performance of your application on a target device or emulator. It analyzes your application for potential performance issues, such as high usage of CPU, memory, file or network operations.

- [Web Inspector](web-inspector.md) **(Debugging with Web Inspector)**

  The Web Inspector tool allows you to debug your Web applications. It supports various features, such as viewing the Web page components, inspecting local and downloaded resources and the JavaScript source page, and performing advanced timing and speed analysis.

- [JavaScript Analyzer](js-analyzer.md) **(Analyzing JavaScript Problems)**

  The JavaScript Analyzer tool makes it easy to find problems in JavaScript code. It supports 2 analyzer types: a static analyzer to check the coding rules and a dynamic analyzer to check stale objects.
