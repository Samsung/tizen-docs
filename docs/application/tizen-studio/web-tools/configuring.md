# Configuring Your Application

The Tizen Studio provides the following set of tools to help you configure your Web application projects:

- [Configuration Editor](config-editor.md) **(Configuring Applications)**		 

   The configuration editor tool allows you to edit the application configuration with a text or form editor. The application configuration includes both specific features and more general runtime settings.

- [Web Localization](web-localization.md) **(Localizing Web Applications)** 

   The **Web Localization** view is used to localize strings, resources, and content of a Tizen Web project. Localization is the process of adapting your application for a specific region or language, allowing the application access to different resources without source code changes.
