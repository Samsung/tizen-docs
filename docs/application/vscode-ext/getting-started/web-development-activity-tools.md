# Tizen Development Activity and Web Application Tools

"Visual Studio Code for Tizen" provides  comprehensive development tools to help you through the overall web development process phases and you can perform all the development activities from the application project creation to testing.

## Managing Projects
<!-- 
  - createing project
  - wasm
  - app sigining (\w certificate manager)
-->
 You can create a new application project with the "`+ Create Project`" button or the command palette(`CTRL` + `P`)'s  "`Tizen: Create Tizen Project`" command, and manage the existing applications in the **Project Explorer** view in Visual Studio Code for Tizen. You can also simply add web assembly module to your application project, and register certificates for your applications to allow them to be published in the application stores.

## Editing Code & Building Your Application
You can use the content assist and API and privilege checker tools to speed up the code writing and verification task.

## Debugging and Profiling Your Application
<!-- 
 - Debug Application

You can debug your application using the Web Inspector based javascript debugger in Visual Studio Code for Tizen. You can set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through your code to identify and fix issues. 

## Running and Testing Your Application
<!--

- sdb
- device manager
- TV Web Simulator
-->
You can run and test your application on an emulator or a real device. You can also use the SDB tool to connect to a device and transfer files between the device and your computer. Additionally, you can use the Device Manager tool to manage connected devices and their settings.


<!-- ## Command Line Interface
- CLI
-->
If you prefer a command line interface (CLI) instead of using Visual Studio Code for Tizen, you can use the Tizen CLI tool. The Tizen CLI tool is a command-line tool that allows you to create, build, test, and package Tizen web applications without using Visual Studio Code for Tizen. It provides similar functionalities as Visual Studio Code for Tizen, but through a command-line interface.

<!-- ## Advanced Topics
