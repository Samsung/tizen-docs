"Visual Studio Code for Tizen" provides  comprehensive development tools to help you through the overall dotnet development process phases and you can perform all the development activities from the application project creation to testing.

## Managing Projects
<!-- 
  - createing project
  - workload & nuget configuration
  - app sigining (\w certificate manager)
-->
 You can create new application projects with command palette(`CTRL` + `P`)'s  "`Tizen: Create Tizen Project`" command, and manage the existing applications in the **Project Explorer** view in Visual Studio Code for Tizen. You can also simply manage necessary nuget sources and workload for your application project, and register certificates for your applications to allow them to be published in the application stores.

## Editing Code & Building Your Application
You can use the content assist and API and privilege checker tools to speed up the code writing and verification task.

## Debugging and Profiling Your Application
<!-- 
 - Debug Application
 - CoreProfiler
 - Memory Profiler
 - Dotnet Diagnostics
-->
You can debug your application using the built-in debugger in Visual Studio Code for Tizen. You can set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through your code to identify and fix issues. Additionally, you can use the CoreProfiler, Memory Profiler, and Dotnet Diagnostics tools to analyze the performance and memory usage of your application. These tools provide detailed information about the application's behavior and help you optimize its performance.

## Running and Testing Your Application
<!-- 
- emulator
- sdb
- device manager
- TV Simulator
-->
You can run and test your application on an emulator or a real device. You can also use the SDB tool to connect to a device and transfer files between the device and your computer. Additionally, you can use the Device Manager tool to manage connected devices and their settings.


<!-- ## Command Line Interface
- CLI
-->
If you prefer a command line interface (CLI) instead of using Visual Studio Code for Tizen, you can use the Tizen.NET CLI tool. The Tizen.NET CLI tool is a command-line tool that allows you to create, build, test, and package Tizen.NET applications without using Visual Studio Code for Tizen. It provides similar functionalities as Visual Studio Code for Tizen, but through a command-line interface.
