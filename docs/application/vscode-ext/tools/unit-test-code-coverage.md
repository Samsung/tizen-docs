# Get Unit Test Information with Code Coverage
Unit Test and Code Coverage is a tool that helps you to understand the code quality of your application. It provides you with the information about how much of your code is covered by unit tests. This is done by providing an interface for viewing and analyzing Native unit test results. It displays the test results in a tree view, illustrating the number of runs, defects, and failures where you can see the details of each test suite and test case. Additionally, it shows the code coverage of your application, highlighting which lines of code are executed during the unit tests.

This helps with the testing experience by allowing you to conveniently review, and understand the outcomes of your native app unit test within the VS Code Extension.
