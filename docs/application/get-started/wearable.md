# Get Started for Wearable

The Get Started Tutorial teaches you how to create basic Tizen applications for wearable device, especially smart watches.

Tizen supports three primary application types for wearable devices:

-   [.NET application](#dotnet-application) is a new way to develop applications for the Tizen operating system using C# language.

-   [Web application](#web-application) is a Web site stored on your device and built using Web-native languages, such as HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The Web application uses the Tizen Web framework to interact with the native subsystems.

-   [Native application](#native-application) is developed using C language. Developer can use the dozens of native API modules that cover a large range of capabilities such as camera, GPS, and accelerometer in addition to more advanced system settings and functionality.

## .NET Application

The following guide demonstrates how to create and run a basic Tizen .NET application:

-   [Wearable .NET application](../dotnet/get-started/wearable/first-app.md)

    A wearable application is targeted to run on a smart watch. The applications can be optimized for the smaller screen.

-   [Wearable XAML application](../dotnet/get-started/wearable/first-xaml-app.md)

    A Wearable XAML application allows you to use XAML to define the visual contents of a page and work together with a C# code-behind file on a smart watch.

First, ensure that you have installed the latest version of Visual Studio Tools for Tizen. [**Learn more >**](../vstools/install.md)

## Web Application

You can create various Web applications to run on smart watches. Tizen Studio supports a few project templates, which automatically create basic functionalities for applications.

The following guide demonstrates how to create and run your first Web application with the project templates:

-   [Wearable Web application](../web/get-started/wearable/first-app.md)

    A wearable application is targeted to run on smart watches, and can be optimized for the smaller screen.

-   [Wearable Web watch application](../web/get-started/wearable-watch/first-app-watch.md)

    A wearable watch application is a customized watch face that can be shown as the device home screen.

-   [Wearable Web widget application](../web/get-started/wearable-widget/first-app-widget.md)

    A wearable widget application is a small application that can be shown by specific UI applications (such as the home screen).

First, ensure that you have installed the latest version of Tizen Studio. <a href="https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-studio/download" target="_blank">

## Native Application

You can create various native applications to run on smart watches. Tizen Studio supports a few project templates, which automatically create basic functionalities for applications.

The following guide demonstrates how to create and run your first  native application with the project templates:

-   [Wearable native application](../native/get-started/wearable/first-app.md)

    A wearable application is targeted to run on smart watches, and can be optimized for the smaller screen.

-   [Wearable native watch application](../native/get-started/wearable-watch/first-app-watch.md)

    A wearable watch application is a customized watch face that can be shown as the device home screen.

-   [Wearable native widget application](../native/get-started/wearable-widget/first-app-widget.md)

    A wearable widget application is a small application that can be shown by specific UI applications (such as the home screen).
