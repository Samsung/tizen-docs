# Get Started for Mobile

The Get Started Tutorial teaches you how to create basic Tizen applications for mobile devices.

Tizen supports three primary application types for mobile:

-   [.NET application](#dotnet-application) is a new way to develop applications for the Tizen operating system using C# language.

-   [Web application](#web-application) is a Web site stored on your device and built using Web-native languages, such as HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The Web application uses the Tizen Web framework to interact with the native subsystems.

-   [Native application](#native-application) is developed using C language. Developer can use the dozens of native API modules that cover a large range of capabilities such as camera, GPS, and accelerometer in addition to more advanced system settings and functionality.
