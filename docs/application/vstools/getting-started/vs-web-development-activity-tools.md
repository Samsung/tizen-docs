# Tizen Development Activity and Web Application Tools

"Visual Studio for Tizen" provides  comprehensive development tools to help you through the overall web development process phases and you can perform all the development activities from the application project creation to testing.

## Managing Projects
<!-- 
  - createing project
  - wasm
  - app sigining (\w certificate manager)
-->
 You can create new application projects in the Visual Studio menu, select **File > New > Project**, and manage the existing applications in the **Solution Explorer** view in Visual Studiofor Tizen. You can also simply add web assembly module to your application project, and register certificates for your applications to allow them to be published in the application stores.

## Editing Code & Building Your Application
You can use the content assist and API and privilege checker tools to speed up the code writing and verification task. The API Privilege Checker tool helps developers identify and resolve previlege-related issues in Tizen applications by analyzing API usage and ensuring complicance with security requirements. It provides detailed reports and suggestions to enhance application security and functionality.

You can run and test your application on an emulator or a real device. You can also use the SDB tool to connect to a device and transfer files between the device and your computer. Additionally, you can use the Device Manager tool to manage connected devices and their settings.


<!-- ## Command Line Interface
- CLI
-->
If you prefer a command line interface (CLI) instead of using Visual Studio for Tizen, you can use the Tizen CLI tool. The Tizen CLI tool is a command-line tool that allows you to create, build, test, and package Tizen web applications without using Visual Studio for Tizen. It provides similar functionalities as Visual Studio for Tizen, but through a command-line interface.
