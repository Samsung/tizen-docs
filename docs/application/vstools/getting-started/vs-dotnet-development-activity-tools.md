# Tizen Development Activity and .NET Application Tools

"Visual Studio for Tizen" provides comprehensive development tools to help you through the overall dotnet development process phases and you can perform all the development activities from the application project creation to testing.

## Managing Projects
<!-- 
  - createing project
  - workload & nuget configuration
  - app sigining (\w certificate manager)
-->
 You can create new application projects in the Visual Studio menu, select **File > New > Project**, and manage the existing applications in the **Solution Explorer** view in Visual Studiofor Tizen. You can also simply manage necessary nuget sources and workload for your application project, and register certificates for your applications to allow them to be published in the application stores.

## Editing Code & Building Your Application
You can use the content assist and API and Privilege Checker tools to speed up the code writing and verification task. The API Privilege Checker tool helps developers identify and resolve previlege-related issues in Tizen applications by analyzing API usage and ensuring complicance with security requirements. It provides detailed reports and suggestions to enhance application security and functionality.

## Debugging and Profiling Your Application
<!-- 
 - Debug Application
 - CoreProfiler
 - Memory Profiler
 - Dotnet Diagnostics
-->
You can debug your application using the built-in debugger in Visual Studio for Tizen. You can set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through your code to identify and fix issues. Additionally, you can use the CoreProfiler, Memory Profiler, and Dotnet Diagnostics tools to analyze the performance and memory usage of your application. These tools provide detailed information about the application's behavior and help you optimize its performance.

## Running and Testing Your Application
<!-- 
- emulator
- sdb
- device manager
- TV Simulator
-->
You can run and test your application on an emulator or a real device. You can also use the SDB tool to connect to a device and transfer files between the device and your computer. Additionally, you can use the Device Manager tool to manage connected devices and their settings.


<!-- ## Command Line Interface
- CLI
-->
If you prefer a command line interface (CLI) instead of using Visual Studio for Tizen, you can use the Tizen.NET CLI tool. The Tizen .NET CLI tool simplifies the developmetn of Tizen applications by providing essential commands for creating, building, and deploying projects directly from the command line. It integrates seamlessly with Visual Studio Tools for Tizen, enabling developers to streamline their workflow and enhance productivity.

<!-- ## Advanced Topics
- Hybrid Application Development
- RPK Application Development
- Tizen Command Palette commands
-->
You also refer to the advanced topics section to learn more about hybrid application development, RPK application development, and other advanced features provided by Visual Studio for Tizen. These topics cover more specialized scenarios and provide additional tools and techniques for developing Tizen applications.
