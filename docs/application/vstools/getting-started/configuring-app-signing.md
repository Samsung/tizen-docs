# Configuring The Application

This section provides instructions on configuring the application for different build environments and target devices.

## Set Build Type

The build type determines how the application is compiled and optimized. Common build types include **Debug**, **Release**, or other custom configurations.

### How to Set the Build Type:

1. Click on the **Build Configuration dropdown** in Visual Studio.
2. Select the desired build configuration (e.g., Debug or Release).

## Set Device & Architecture

The application architecture depends on the selected target device. The chosen device’s architecture (e.g., **x86, x64, ARM**) determines the application’s build architecture.

### How to Select Device & Architecture:

1. Click on the **Debug and Run** dropdown in Visual Studio.
2. Select the target device from the available list.
