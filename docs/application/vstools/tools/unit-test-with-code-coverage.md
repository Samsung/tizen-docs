# Unit Test with Code Coverage

The Code Coverage is a profiling tool used to determine the coverage details of Tizen Native Applications. It helps you to understand the code quality of your application. The Code Coverage tool finds the parts of the code covered during the execution of the unit test cases. A program with high code coverage (measured in percentage) implies that most of the source code is covered during testing, and the source code has a lower chance of containing undetected software bugs.

The code coverage tool in the Tizen Extension for Visual Studio is based on the `llvm-cov` tool. Using the Code Coverage tool, you can detect parts of code that are not covered by a unit test, and ensure that the uncovered code does not cause errors at runtime. The Code Coverage tool supports functional, statement, and branch coverage.

With a Unit Test, you can verify that your code works well, and increases its reliability. Tizen Studio Extension for VS provides the creating, building, and editing tools for unit tests, and a view for checking and analyzing the test results.
It uses the `gtest` framework to make and launch the test cases. To manage your test cases, you can use the test explorer view.
