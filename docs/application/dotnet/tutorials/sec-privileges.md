# Security and API Privileges

To effectively protect the device system and user private data, the
Tizen security architecture is based on privileges and application
signing of the Linux basic security model, which includes process
isolation and mandatory access control. Since Tizen, as an open 
platform, provides a wide range of features and experiences for users
with a variety of applications, the users must be able to grant
privileges for security-sensitive operations.

Tizen provides API-level access control for security-sensitive
operations which, if not used properly, can harm user privacy and
system stability. Therefore, applications that use such sensitive APIs
must declare the required privileges in the
tizen-manifest.xml file.
Privileges are categorized into public, partner, and platform levels
according to their hierarchy:

-   The public level is the minimum privilege level, which means that
    any application developed using Tizen Studio can use
    these privileges.
-   The partner level privileges require at least a partner-signed
    certificate which is granted to developers who have a business
    relationship with the vendor.
-   The platform level is the highest privilege level, and an
    application that needs these privileges requires at least a
    platform-signed certificate, which is granted to vendor developers.

Since Tizen platform 3.0, some privileges are categorized as
privacy-related and gives an option to the user to switch them **on** and
**off**. If an application invokes a privacy-related privileged API, the
Tizen system checks whether the privilege is **allowed** for the
application. For the application to use the API, the privilege must be
declared in the `tizen-manifest.xml` file and the user must have
switched it **on**.

> **Note**  
> In applications with the platform version 3.0 or higher, if you use privacy-related privileged APIs, make sure that the user has switched the privilege on before making the function call. Otherwise, the application does not work as expected.
>
> Since Tizen 4.0, the status of privacy-related privileges can be [resolved at runtime](../guides/security/requesting-permissions.md) using the [Privacy Privilege Manager API](../api/tizenfx/api/Tizen.Security.PrivacyPrivilegeManager.html).

Tizen Studio also provides privilege checker tools to check whether the Tizen application source code contains any privilege violations. For more information, see [Verifying APIs and
Privileges](../../tizen-studio/native-tools/api-checker.md).

## .NET API Privileges

The following table lists the API privileges, which you must declare
when using security-sensitive API modules in .net applications:

**Table: .NET API privileges**

## Non-API Bound Privileges


Tizen application privileges are loosely bound to APIs, so most of the
privileges can be identified by the APIs that the application calls.
However, there are some privileges that are not coupled with Tizen
APIs. To allow easy identification, those privileges are mapped to
corresponding system resources that are similar to other privileges.

The following table lists the non-API bound privileges:

**Table: Non-API bound privileges**

| Privilege                                | Level  | Privacy  | Description                              |
|----------------------------------------|------|------|----------------------------------------|
| `http://tizen.org/privilege/internet`    | public |  | Most of the mobile and wearable devices use a cellular network for IP communication. However, the cellular network can cause data costs and an application that sends data through the internet can be crucial for user privacy. Due to the importance of the functionality, a privilege for controlling application internet access has been added.<br><br>The new privilege is coupled with IP addresses of the destination and source of the IP packets. If your socket is connecting or listening to any IP address except 127.0.0.1, this privilege is required to communicate properly. If your application does not have this privilege, the connection is blocked in the kernel layer. If you are listening to a socket, you never receive any packets from the outside without errors on the socket functions.<br><br>You cannot connect to a random application (due to sandboxing) no matter how you add this privilege but you can connect between multiple processes of the same application binary. |
| `http://tizen.org/privilege/mediastorage` | public | Storage | When you connect the device to a computer (Windows&reg; or macOS) through USB, you can access a dedicated media storage area shown as massive media storage. This region of the storage is called media storage and is usually used for multimedia files, such as photos, videos, and music files. Since this storage area is used for user private data, access to it must be protected with a privilege.<br>If your application does not have this privilege, no file operations into the media storage area succeed and you receive a permission denied error. If you have this privilege, you can read and write directories and files, create new files, and delete files in the storage area.<br><br>This privilege is treated as privacy privilege since platform version 4.0. |
| `http://tizen.org/privilege/externalstorage` | public | Storage | Similar to the media storage, many devices support external storages, such as MicroSD card or USB memory. As with the media storage, the access to an external storage must be protected with a privilege. You can find the absolute path of the external storage with the [Storage](../api/tizenfx/api/Tizen.System.Storage.html) API functions, such as `GetAbsolutePath()` method.<br>If your application does not have this privilege, all file operations fail with a permission denied error. If you have this privilege, you have full access to the external storage.<br><br>This privilege is treated as privacy privilege since platform version 4.0. |
| `http://tizen.org/privilege/externalstorage.appdata` | public |  | Many devices support external storages, such as MicroSD card or USB memory. As with the media storage, the access to an external storage must be protected with a privilege.<br><br>If your application does not have this privilege, no file operations with the application data stored in the external storage area succeed and you receive a permission denied error. If you have this privilege, you can store data in the application-specific directory of the external storage. You can get the absolute path to the application's external data directory with `ExternalData` property of `Tizen.Applications.DirectoryInfo`. |
| `http://tizen.org/privilege/appdir.shareddata` | public |  | Since Tizen 3.0, the application must have this privilege to support the `shared/data` directory.<br><br>You can get share directory path with `SharedDataPath` property of `Tizen.Applications.ApplicationInfo` if the application have shared/data directory. Note that the `shared/data` directory is writable for the application itself and readable for all other applications. You must be careful when you use this privilege and share data through the `shared/data` directory. For a more secure way of sharing files with another application, try to pass the file path through an application control. |
