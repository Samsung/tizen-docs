# Get Started with .NET Applications

You can create the Tizen .NET applications in C#. You can also use the Tizen .NET APIs to access the Tizen platform-specific features.

To create your first Tizen .NET application, you can select from the following profiles:

-   [Wearable .NET application](wearable/first-app.md)

    An application that is targeted to run on smartwatches. It can be optimized for small screens.

-   [Wearable XAML application](wearable/first-xaml-app.md)

    An application that allows you to use XAML to define the visual contents of a page and work together with a C# code-behind file on smartwatches.

-   [TV .NET application](tv/first-app.md)

    An application that is targeted to run on smart TVs. It can be optimized for large screens and remote controls.

-   [Mobile .NET application](mobile/first-app.md)

    An application that is targeted to run on smartphones. It can take advantage of the functionalities available on smartphones.

-   [NUI .NET application](nui/quickstart.md)

    An application that is targeted to run on a wide range of Tizen devices such as mobile devices, TVs, and wearables. 
    NUI is a rich GUI library used for creating two-dimensional or three-dimensional applications.

-   [IoT .NET application](iot/first-app.md)

    An application that is targeted to run on IoT devices. It can be optimized for both headed as well as headless IoT devices.

The examples in each profile explain a simple application with a basic UI and minimal functionality. 
Get familiar with these examples, and then you can build more complex applications.
