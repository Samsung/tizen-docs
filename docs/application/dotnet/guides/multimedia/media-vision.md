# Visual Detection and Recognition


You can perform various visual detection and recognition tasks in your application. You can detect or generate barcodes. In addition, you can track how faces or image objects move as well as detect and recognize faces or objects.

You can use the following visual detection and recognition features in your .NET applications:

-   [Barcode Detection and Generation](image-barcode.md)

    You can handle images containing barcodes. You can encrypt a message by [generating a barcode](/application/dotnet/api/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Multimedia.Vision.BarcodeGenerator.html) from it,
    and you can also [detect barcodes](/application/dotnet/api/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Multimedia.Vision.BarcodeDetector.html) in an image or from a camera preview stream.

-   [Deep Learning Based Face Recognition](face-recognition.md)

    You can [register, unregister and recognize a face](/application/dotnet/api/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Multimedia.Vision.DeepLearningFaceRecognizer.html) in your application with more accuracy, which uses deep learning technique.

-   [Face Detection, Recognition, and Tracking](face-detection.md)

    You can [detect a face](/application/dotnet/api/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Multimedia.Vision.FaceDetector.html) from an image,
    and [recognize a face](/application/dotnet/api/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Multimedia.Vision.FaceRecognizer.html) with a set of examples.
    You can also [track a face](/application/dotnet/api/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Multimedia.Vision.FaceTracker.html) within the camera preview stream.

-   [Image Recognition and Tracking](image-recognition.md)

    You can [extract the features of an image object and recognize them](/application/dotnet/api/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Multimedia.Vision.ImageRecognizer.html) from specific images.
    You can also [track the image object](/application/dotnet/api/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Multimedia.Vision.ImageTracker.html) within the camera preview stream.

-   [Pose Detection](pose-detection.md)

    You can [detect a human body and recognize the pose](/application/dotnet/api/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Multimedia.Vision.PoseLandmarkDetector.html) with specific motion data describing the pose.

-   [ROI Tracker](roi-tracker.md)

    You can [obtain the proper ROI coordinates](/application/dotnet/api/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Multimedia.Vision.RoiTracker.html) that the user wants to track.
