# Tizen .NET Guides

Tizen .NET provides a rich set of interfaces allowing you to build compelling TV, mobile, and wearable applications which achieve native performance.

Tizen .NET guides introduce various features for Tizen .NET applications. The features are supported in the TizenFX API, and you can use them in creating Tizen applications.

The TizenFX API allows applications to call into platform-specific functionality from the shared code. This functionality enables Xamarin.Forms applications to do things a native application can do, without causing the portable part of the application to become littered with operating system-specific details.

Select the feature you are interested in and see what Tizen offers for your application:

- [Application Management](app-management/overview.md)

  The application management feature covers various application models available for Tizen .NET applications. They describe the application life-cycle, resources, and the communication methods available for the application.

- [Natural User Interface](nui/NUIoverview.md)

  The Natural User Interface (NUI) features provide various aspects of creating a visual outlook for the user application to ensure the best user experience. NUI is a rich GUI library for creating a 2-dimensional or a 3-dimensional applications. These applications run on a range of Tizen devices, such as TVs and wearables. NUI is built on a multi-threaded architecture by enabling realistic smooth animations.

- [Internationalization](internationalization/phonenumber.md)

  The localization feature ensures that your application is functional in different locations and time zones. Additionally, it also gives the formatted phone numbers and international standardized phone numbers based on the current location of your device.

- [Notifications and Content Sharing](notification/overview.md)

  The notifications and content sharing features introduce how you can inform the user of important events and allow the user to share content between applications.

- [Alarms and Scheduling](alarm/overview.md)

  The alarms and scheduling features introduce how you can define and store alarms.

- [Media and Camera](multimedia/overview.md)

  The media and camera features cover everything related to multimedia. You can record and play various media formats, use the device camera to take pictures, and listen to the radio. You can also handle media conversions and manage media streams.

- [Connectivity and Wireless](connectivity/overview.md)

  The connectivity features define how you can connect your application to the outside world, and send and receive data. You can create connections to various networks, servers, and other devices.

- [Messaging](messaging/overview.md)

  The messaging features introduce how you can send and receive text and multimedia messages, and manage emails. You can also create a push server to use the push messaging service to deliver push notifications to the application.

- [Location and Sensors](location-sensors/overview.md)

  The location and sensor features provide information about the geographical location and surrounding environment of the device. You can create location-based applications that track the user location and use maps. You can also access data from various device sensors, which provide information on the physical environment the device is in, and the gestures and activities the user engages in.

- [Text Input and Voice](text-input/text-input-cover.md)

  The text input and voice features introduce how you can convert speech to text and back to speech, or provide customized keyboards. You can also define commands to allow the user to control the application with their voice.

- [Personal Data](personal/overview.md)

  The personal data features cover the handling of secure data related to the user. You can manage and sync user accounts, and authenticate the user to allow them to access services. You can also manage various user data on the device, such as their application usage patterns.

- [Data Storage and Management](data/overview.md)

  The data storage and management features cover the methods you can use to handle data in your applications. You can access data from the device system and various storages.

- [Device Settings and Systems](device/overview.md)

  The device settings and systems features introduce how you can set and get information about the system. You can also access information about attached devices, and manage the sound and vibration feedback given to the user.

- [Security](security/overview.md)

  The security features ensure that private information remains private, and that the user knows when they are trying to access privileged information. You can use a repository to manage keys, certificates, and sensitive user data. When the user tries to access privileged information, you can display information about the data.

- [Natural Language Processing](nlp/overview.md)

  The natural language process features explains the methods by which you can handle all the sentences in your applications. You can get the results using the NLP service.
