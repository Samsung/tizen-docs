# Tizen .NET Guides


Tizen .NET provides a rich set of interfaces allowing you to build compelling TV, mobile, and wearable applications which achieve native performance.

Tizen .NET guides introduce various features for Tizen .NET applications. The features are supported in the TizenFX API, and you can use them in creating Tizen applications.

The TizenFX API allows applications to call into platform-specific functionality from the shared code. This functionality enables Xamarin.Forms applications to do things a native application can do, without causing the portable part of the application to become littered with operating system-specific details.
