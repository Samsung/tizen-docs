# Application Management

The application management features cover application resources, the communication methods available for the application, and getting application information.

You can use the following application management features in your .NET applications:

- [Application Icons](app-icons.md)

  You can show the application icon as a shortcut on the home screen to allow the user to easily access it. In the device application list, you can show a badge with the application icon to provide additional information about the application state or notifications to the user.

- [Application Manager](app-manager.md)

  You can retrieve information about the applications installed on the device. You can also get information about the currently-running application.
