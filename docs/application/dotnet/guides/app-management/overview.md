# Application Management

The application management features cover application resources, the communication methods available for the application, and getting application information.

You can use the following application management features in your .NET applications:

- [Application Icons](app-icons.md)

  You can show the application icon as a shortcut on the home screen to allow the user to easily access it. In the device application list, you can show a badge with the application icon to provide additional information about the application state or notifications to the user.

- [Application Manager](app-manager.md)

  You can retrieve information about the applications installed on the device. You can also get information about the currently-running application.

- [Application Launcher](application-launcher.md)

  You can create your own application launcher. The application launcher is a main application that normally starts after system boot.

- [Application Preference](application-preference.md)

  You can save data in the persistent memory and read them in the next session in a safe way.

  You can communicate with applications in other devices.

  You can retrieve information about the packages installed on the device. You can also monitor for changes in the device packages.
