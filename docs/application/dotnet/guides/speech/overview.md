# Speech and Voice

The speech and voice features introduce how you can convert speech to text and back to speech, and manage voice commands.

You can use the following speech and voice features in your .NET applications:

-   [Speech-to-text](stt.md)

    You can recognize sound data recorded by the user and send the result as text. The result text can, for example, be displayed on the screen.

-   [Text-to-speech](tts.md)

    You can synthesize text into sound data as utterances and play it. You can also control the playback by pausing, resuming, and stopping it, as needed.

-   [Voice Control](voice-control.md)

    You can allow the user to control the device through voice commands. You can register voice commands, which trigger a callback when the user speaks them.
