# Machine Learning


Machine learning features help you to handle machine learning frameworks, like TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite, with the construction of a data pipeline.

You can use the following machine learning features in your .NET applications:

- [Machine Learning Inference](machine-learning-inference.md)

  You can create data pipelines that contain machine learning model filters. The pipeline can be assembled and controlled with various elements of [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/){:target="_blank"}.

- [Machine Learning Train](machine-learning-train.md)

  You can construct, control, and train a machine learning model on the fly. The training can be done using the code or with a set of formats that describe the model. These models can be trained on the device locally when needed.
