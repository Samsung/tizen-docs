# Connectivity and Wireless

The connectivity and wireless features introduce how you can manage wireless connections to other devices and networks. They also describe how you can download content, and send and receive data in your application.

You can use the following connectivity and wireless features in your .NET applications:

-   [Bluetooth](bluetooth.md)

    You can use Bluetooth functionalities in your application, such as managing the Bluetooth service, pairing, and exchanging messages. The Bluetooth standard provides a peer-to-peer (P2P) data exchange functionality over short distance between compliant devices.

-   [Near Field Communication (NFC)](nfc.md)

    You can share contacts, photos, and videos, use the device as a smart card, and communicate with other NFC-enabled devices. You can use an NFC-enabled device to communicate with NFC tags for a variety of activities, such as paying the grocery bill or downloading a coupon.

-   [Smart Card](smartcard.md)

    You can use smart card functionalities to access secure elements. You can open a channel to the secure element, send a command, and receive a response.

-   [Wi-Fi](wifi.md)

    You can connect to a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and transfer data over the network. You can activate and deactivate a local Wi-Fi device, and to connect to a WLAN network in the infrastructure mode.

-   [Wi-Fi DirectÂ®](wifi-direct.md)

    You can find nearby Wi-Fi Direct devices and discover their details. You can also form a Wi-Fi Direct group to communicate over a peer-to-peer link without wireless access points (base stations) in the infrastructure mode.

- [Smart Traffic Control (STC)](stc.md)

  You can retrieve statistics about the network data consumption fetched by the system and by the applications.
  
-   [Telephony Information](telephony.md)

    You can access various information from the Telephony Service. You can access details about the voice and video call states, currently used SIM card, and modem. You can also retrieve general details about the telephony network the device is currently connected to.

-   [Internet and Content Downloads](internet-download.md)

    You can connect to the Internet and access its various services. You can transfer content through network and socket connections.

-   [IoT Connectivity](iotcon.md)
