## Setting the Background Color

You can set a background color for a UI component. To set a red background for a component:

```
View view = new View();
view.Size2D = new Size2D(200, 200);
view.BackgroundColor = Color.Red;
```

You can handle all existing views similarly. For example, to set the background color for a TextLabel:

```
TextLabel label = new TextLabel( "Hello World" );
label.BackgroundColor = Color.Red;
```
