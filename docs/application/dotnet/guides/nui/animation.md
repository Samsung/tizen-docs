# Animation

You can use animations to allow objects to move around and change their properties for a specified duration. NUI implements an easy-to-use animation framework that allows you to create visually rich applications. The `Tizen.NUI.Animation` class can be used to animate the [animatable properties](#animatableproperties) for any number of objects, typically view object.

NUI animations [occur in a dedicated thread](multithreading.md). This allows animations to run smoothly, regardless of the time taken to process the input, events, and other factors in the application code.

## Animatable Properties

Some view properties are `animatable`, such as `Position`, `Orientation`, `Scale`, and `Color`.

<div style="text-align:center;width:100%;"><img src="./media/properties.svg" /></div>

See the `Remarks` section of the properties in [Tizen.NUI.BaseComponents.View](https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.NUI.BaseComponents.View.html) to see whether the property is *animatable*.

### Basic Animation Methods

To animate a property in NUI, you can use two distinct methods:


-   `AnimateTo()`: animates a property to the target value during a given time.
    ```csharp
    // Animates PositionX to 50
    var animation = new Animation(2000/*duration*/);

    animation.AnimateTo(view, "PositionX", 50);
    
    animation.Play();
    ```

-   `AnimateBy()`: animates a property by the specified amount during a given time.
    ```csharp
    // Animates PositionX to x + 50

    var animation = new Animation(2000/*duration*/);

    animation.AnimateBy(view, "PositionX", 50);

    animation.Play();
    ```

You can define multiple animating behaviors in a single Animation.
```csharp
// Animate ScaleX of View1 and PositionY of View2 at once

var animation = new Animation(2000/*duration*/);

animation.AnimateBy(view1, "ScaleX", 2);

animation.AnimateBy(view2, "PositionY", 100);

animation.Play();
```

### KeyFrame Animation
NUI provides support for animating between several different values for a View. This can be done by defining the `KeyFrames`.

The code below shows how to create `KeyFrames`.
```csharp
KeyFrames keyFrames = KeyFrames::New();

keyFrames.Add(0.0f /*  0%*/, new Position(0, 0));
keyFrames.Add(0.25f/* 25%*/, new Position(200, 0));
keyFrames.Add(0.5f /* 50%*/, new Position(200, 100));
keyFrames.Add(0.75f/* 75%*/, new Position(0, 100));
keyFrames.Add(1.0f /*100%*/, new Position(0, 0));
```

Next, you can add it to your animation by using `AnimateBetween()`.

```csharp
animation.AnimateBetween(view, "Position", keyFrames);
animation.Play();
```

Check the result!

## Playback and Events

After the animation is created, you can control its playback:

- To play the animation:

    ```csharp
    animation.Play();
    ```

- To pause or stop the animation:

    ```csharp
    animation.Pause();
    animation.Stop();
    ```

- To loop the animation:

    ```csharp
    animation.Looping = true;
    ```

- By default, when the animation ends, the properties that is animating are saved. If you want to discard the property changes when either the animation ends or stops:

    ```csharp
    animation.EndAction = Animations.EndActions.Discard;
    ```

During the playback, you can receive notifications at various stages of the animation, such as the following:

-   `ProgressReached`: Notify when the animation progress has reached a specific percentage

    ```csharp
    // Trigger the 'ProgressReached' event to 50% of animation time
    animation.ProgressNotification = 0.5;

    animation.ProgressReached += progressReachedCallback;
    ```

-   `Finished`: Notify when the animation finishes
    ```csharp
    animation.Finished += animationFinishedCallback;
    ```

## Alpha Functions

In animations, alpha functions are used to specify the an animation progresses over time. This allows the animation to be, for example, accelerated, decelerated, repeated, or bounced.

### Built-in Alpha Function

The simplest way to define an alpha function is to use `built-in alpha function` which NUI provides for the convenience.
See [Tizen.NUI.AlphaFunction.BuiltinFunctions](https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.NUI.AlphaFunction.BuiltinFunctions.html), to check a supporting list.

The following example shows how to create an AlphaFunction with a built-in item.
```csharp
var easeOut = new AlphaFunction(AlphaFunction.BuiltinFunctions.EaseOut);
```

You can apply it to the animation by setting is as a `DefaultAlphaFunction`:

```csharp
var animation = new Animation(2000/*duration*/);

animation.DefaultAlphaFunction = easeOut;

animation.AnimateBy(view, "PositionX", 200);

animation.Play();
```

Check out how `EaseOut` animation works in the picture below compared with other built-in functions.

<div style="text-align:center;width:100%;"><img src="./media/easeout.svg" /></div>

You can also specify the alpha function for each animating method:

```csharp
// Animation in 0 ~ 500ms : speeds up
animation.AnimateBy(view, "PositionX", 100, 0, 500, easeIn);

// Animation in 500 ~ 1000ms : slows to a gradual stop
animation.AnimateBy(view, "PositionX", 100, 500, 1000, easeOut);
```


### Create Your Own Alpha Function
Let's create your own alpha function using `Bézier Curves`, by setting two control points, C1 and C2. The control points are for a Bézier curve whose end points are fixed at (0, 0) and (1, 1) respectively.

```csharp
// Define two control points C1, C2
var c1 = new Vector2(0.0f, 0.5f);
var c2 = new Vector2(0.5f, 1.0f);

var customAlphaFunction = new AlphaFunction(c1, c2);
```
As you see in the first graph, the control points `C1(0, 0.5)` and `C2(0.5, 1)` make a curve that increases rapidly in the start and then slow down to the end. This means that the animation with this alpha function will have a same speed progress. See how the circles below the graphs are moving.

## Sample Animation

You can use an `animation-hello-world.cs` sample to see in practice how the `AnimateBy()` and `AnimateTo()` methods, and alpha functions work.

After setting up your NUI development environment and building the NUI source code, follow the below steps:

1.  Download the [sample file](nui-example-code/animation-hello-world-tutorial.cs).
2.  Copy the sample file to your `nuirun` or `nuirun/tutorials`.
3.  Run the sample application.
