## Overview

The slider has 2 important elements:

- The handle is the indicator sliding within the range.

  You can draw the handle using the `HandleVisual` property.

- The track is the bar along which the handle moves.

  The slider draws the track using 2 distinct images. The region between the start of the track and the handle is the progress region, and you can draw it using the `ProgressVisual` property. The region between the handle and the end of the track is drawn using the `TrackVisual` property.

## Creating a Slider

The following basic example shows how to create a `Slider` object:

```
// Create a Slider instance
Window window = Window.Instance;
Slider slider = new Slider();
slider.BackgroundColor = new Color(1, 1, 0, 1);
slider.Position = new Position(0, windowHeight * 0.2, 0);
slider.PivotPoint = PivotPoint.TopLeft;
slider.Size2D = new Size2D(100, 100);
window.Add(slider);
```

## Customizing the Slider Appearance

The slider provides a set of default images, which are used automatically if you do not specify anything else.

If you want to customize the slider appearance, you can assign your own images using the `PropertyMap` class. You can set the size and image of the track, handle, progress region, popup, and popup arrow.
