# XAML Guide

## XAML supported in Tizen.NUI

XAML — the eXtensible Application Markup Language — allows developers to define user interfaces in Tizen.NUI applications using markup rather than code. XAML is never required in a Tizen.NUI program, but it is often more succinct and more visually coherent than equivalent code, and potentially toolable. XAML is particularly well suited for using with the popular MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) application architecture: XAML defines the View that is linked to ViewModel code through XAML-based data bindings.
