# Voice Control


Voice control features allow the user to control the device through their voice. You can register general voice commands, which allow you to recognize the sound data recorded by the user and send the result as a predefined command using the Voice control service.

The main features of the Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl namespace include:

-   Managing commands

    You can use the Voice control service to register commands as foreground or background type. When the user speaks a registered command, the callback returns the recognition result.

-   Retrieving information

    You can [get various information](#info) from the voice control:

    -   Voice control state

        The state is changed by method calls and applied as a precondition of each method call.

    -   Voice control service state

        The user controls the state by starting and stopping command recognition.

    -   Current language

        A command is valid only when the command language is the same as the current language. The current language can be changed by changing the application or display language on the device.

        You can get a notification of the language change in a callback. If the display language is changed to a non-supported one, the voice control language changes to English.

    -   Supported language

        You can retrieve a list of supported languages to check whether the language that you want is supported.

To use the voice control:

1.  Set up the voice control and [register callbacks](#callback).

    The initialization allows the voice control to distinguish your application from any other applications also using voice control. The registered callbacks allow you to receive notifications about changes in the service state, language, and recognition result, and about any errors.

2.  Prepare the voice control.

    The preparation connects the Voice control service for background work, such as recording and recognizing the user voice.

    When the application initializes and prepares the voice control, the Voice control daemon is invoked and connected for background work. The daemon and the application communicate as server and client.

3.  Set commands.

    You can [create a command list](#commands), and add or remove individual commands in the list. When creating an individual command, set the command text and type for each command handle. When all commands are created and added to the command list, set the command list to the voice control for recognition.

4.  Get the recognition result.

    The recognition result is sent through a registered callback.

    If the registered command is duplicated or the user speaks multiple commands, the recognition result can contain multiple results. If you set duplicated commands, the Voice control service can reject the command. The rejection is shown in the result event.

5.  When no longer needed, unprepare and deinitialize the voice control.

    You must disconnect the voice control service and deinitialize the voice control using the `Unprepare()` and `Deinitialize()` methods of the [Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.VoiceControlClient](https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.VoiceControlClient.html) class.

The following figure illustrates the voice control life-cycle states.

## Prerequisites


To enable your application to use the voice control functionality:

1.  To use the methods and properties of the [Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.VoiceControlClient](https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.VoiceControlClient.html) class, include it in your application:

    ```
    using Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.VoiceControlClient;
    ```

2.  Initialize the voice control with the `Initialize()` method of the `Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.VoiceControlClient` class:

    ```
    void initialize_voice_control()
    {
        VoiceControlClient.Initialize();
    }
    ```

    If the method call is successful, the voice control state changes to `Initialized` (the states are defined in the [Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.State](https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.State.html) enumeration).

    > **Note**   
	> The voice control feature is not thread-safe and depends on the Ecore main loop. Implement voice control within the Ecore main loop and do not use it in a thread.

3.  Prepare the Voice control service with the `Prepare()` method of the `Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.VoiceControlClient` class, which connects the background Voice control daemon. The daemon records and recognizes audio data and converts sound to text.

    ```
    void prepare_vc()
    {
        VoiceControlClient.Prepare();
    }
    ```

    The `Prepare()` method is asynchronous, and when the preparation succeeds, the voice control state changes from `Initialized` to `Ready`. If the `Prepare()` method fails, the error callback is triggered.

4.  When the voice control is no longer needed, unprepare and deinitialize it:

    ```
    void unprepared_vc()
    {
        VoiceControlClient.Unprepare();
    }

    void deinitialize_voice_control()
    {
        VoiceControlClient.Deinitialize();
    }
    ```

    When the `Unprepare()` method of the `Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.VoiceControlClient` class succeeds, the voice control state changes from `Ready` to `Initialized`.

    > **Note**   
	> Do not call the `Deinitialize()` method of the `Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.VoiceControlClient` class in a callback. Within a callback, the `Deinitialize()` method fails and returns `ErrorCode.OperationFailed`.

## Managing Callbacks

To set and unset callbacks to get notifications about recognition results, state changes, and errors:

> **Note**   
> Set and unset all callbacks when the voice control state is `Initialized` (the states are defined in the [Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.State](https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.State.html) enumeration).

-   Set the state change callback to be invoked when the voice control state changes:

    ```
    /// Callback
    void VoiceControlStateChanged(object sender, StateChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        /// Your code
    }

    /// Set and unset
    void SetUnsetStateChangedCb()
    {
        try
        {
            VoiceControlClient.Initialize();

            /// Set the callback for the StateChanged event
            VoiceControlClient.StateChanged += VoiceControlStateChanged;

            /// Unset the callback
            VoiceControlClient.StateChanged -= VoiceControlStateChanged;
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            /// Error handling
        }
    }
    ```

-   Set the service state change callback to be invoked when the Voice control service state changes:

    ```
    /// Callback
    void VoiceControlServiceStateChanged(object sender, ServiceStateChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        /// Your code
    }

    /// Set and unset
    void SetUnsetServiceStateChangedCb()
    {
        try
        {
            VoiceControlClient.Initialize();

            /// Set the callback for the ServiceStateChanged event
            VoiceControlClient.ServiceStateChanged += VoiceControlServiceStateChanged;

            /// Unset the callback
            VoiceControlClient.ServiceStateChanged -= VoiceControlServiceStateChanged;
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            /// Error handling
        }
    }
    ```

-   Set the current language change callback to be invoked when the system or application language changes:

    ```
    /// Callback
    void VoiceControlCurrentLanguageChanged(object sender, CurrentLanguageChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        /// Your code
    }

    /// Set and unset
    void SetUnsetCurrentLanguageChangedCb()
    {
        try
        {
            VoiceControlClient.Initialize();

            /// Set the callback for the CurrentLanguageChanged event
            VoiceControlClient.CurrentLanguageChanged += VoiceControlCurrentLanguageChanged;

            /// Unset the callback
            VoiceControlClient.CurrentLanguageChanged -= VoiceControlCurrentLanguageChanged;
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            /// Error handling
        }
    }
    ```

-   Set the recognition result callback to be invoked when a voice command is recognized.

    > **Note**   
	> If the recognition result produces a reject event, the Voice control service has rejected the recognized command. Make sure that the command does not conflict with other commands and there are no duplicated commands.

    To get the command, use the methods of the [Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.VoiceCommandList](https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.VoiceCommandList.html) class, which represents a list of recognized commands. The `Command` property of the [Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.VoiceCommand](https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.VoiceCommand.html) class contains the recognized text.

    ```
    /// Callback
    void VoiceControlRecognitionResult(object sender, RecognitionResultEventArgs e)
    {
        /// Your code
    }

    /// Set and unset
    void SetUnsetRecognitionResultCb()
    {
        try
        {
            VoiceControlClient.Initialize();

            /// Set the callback for the RecognitionResult event
            VoiceControlClient.RecognitionResult += VoiceControlRecognitionResult;

            /// Unset the callback
            VoiceControlClient.RecognitionResult -= VoiceControlRecognitionResult;
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            /// Error handling
        }
    }
    ```

-   Set the error callback to be invoked when an error occurs in the voice control process:

    ```
    /// Callback
    void VoiceControlErrorOccured(object sender, ErrorOccuredEventArgs e)
    {
        /// Your code
    }

    /// Set and Unset
    void SetUnsetErrorOccuredCb()
    {
        try
        {
            VoiceControlClient.Initialize();

            /// Set the callback for the ErrorOccured event
            VoiceControlClient.ErrorOccured += VoiceControlErrorOccured;

            /// Unset the callback
            VoiceControlClient.ErrorOccured -= VoiceControlErrorOccured;
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            /// Error handling
        }
    }
    ```

## Retrieving Voice Control Information

To get information about the current states, and current and supported languages:

-   Get the current voice control state using the `State` property of the [Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.VoiceControlClient](https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.VoiceControlClient.html) class.

    The voice control state changes according to method calls when the voice control is, for example, initialized and prepared.

    ```
    void get_state()
    {
        State current_state;
        current_state = VoiceControlClient.State;
    }
    ```

-   Get the current voice control service state using the `ServiceState` property.

    The user controls the voice control service state. In a general scenario:

    1.  The user starts recording for recognition by using a voice application, button, or voice trigger. If the start is successful, the voice control service state changes to `Recording` (the states are defined in the [Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.ServiceState](https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.ServiceState.html) enumeration).
    2.  After recording, the service state changes to `Processing` for recognition processing.
    3.  After recognition is completed, the service state returns to `Ready`.

    If the application uses continuous recognition, the voice control service state can be changed from `Processing` directly to `Recording`.

    ```
    void get_service_state()
    {
        ServiceState current_service_state;
        current_service_state = VoiceControlClient.ServiceState;
    }
    ```

-   Get the supported languages with a foreach method that triggers a separate callback for each language.

    As long as the callback returns `true`, the foreach method continues to loop over the supported languages.

    ```
    void get_supported_language()
    {
        try
        {
            VoiceControlClient.Initialize();

            List<string> list = (List<string>)VoiceControlClient.GetSupportedLanguages();
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            /// Error handling
        }
    }
    ```

-   Get the current language with the `CurrentLanguage` property. The voice control recognition works for the current (default) language. Use the language change callback to be notified of language changes.

## Managing Commands

To create a command list and commands:

1.  Create a command list with a command list handle.

    The command list can include many commands, which each have a command text and type. The list can have both the `Foreground` and `Background` type commands (the types are defined in the [Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.CommandType](https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.CommandType.html) enumeration. The foreground commands are valid when the application is in a visible state and the background commands are valid when the application is in a visible or invisible state.

    You can access the command list after you set it to the voice control and when you get the recognition result.

    ```
    void create_command_list()
    {
        try
        {
            VoiceCommandList list = new VoiceCommandList();
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            /// Error handling
        }
    }
    ```

2.  Create a command.

    First create a command handle, and then define the command and type.

    ```
    void create_command()
    {
        try
        {
            VoiceCommand command = new VoiceCommand();

            command.Command = "open";
            command.Type = CommandType.Foreground;
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            /// Error handling
        }
    }
    ```

3.  Add the command to the command list.

    If necessary, you can also remove commands from the command list.

    ```
    void add_command()
    {
        try
        {
            VoiceCommandList list = new VoiceCommandList();
            VoiceCommand command = new VoiceCommand();

            command.Command = "open";
            command.Type = CommandType.Foreground;

            list.Add(command);
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            /// Error handling
        }
    }

    void remove_command()
    {
        try
        {
            VoiceCommand command = new VoiceCommand();

            command.Command = "open";
            command.Type = CommandType.Foreground;

            /// Other actions

            list.Remove(command);
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            /// Error handling
        }
    }
    ```

    To retrieve the commands you have added to the command list:

    -   You can use the `GetAllCommands()` method of the [Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.VoiceCommandList](https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.VoiceCommandList.html) class to get all commands from the command list:

        ```
        void foreach_command()
        {
            try
            {
                VoiceCommandList VoiceControlCmdList = new VoiceCommandList();
                List<VoiceCommand> list = (List<VoiceCommand>)VoiceControlCmdList.GetAllCommands();
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                /// Error handling
            }
        }
        ```

    -   You can use the `Current` property of the `Tizen.Uix.VoiceControl.VoiceCommandList` class to get the current command in an output parameter.

           > **Note**   
		   > When you get the command handle with the `VoiceCommandList.Current` property, do not release it. To release the command handle, call the `Remove()` method of the `VoiceCommandList` class before destroying the `VoiceCommand` object.

        ```
        void get_commands()
        {
            try
            {
                VoiceCommand current_command = new VoiceCommand();
                VoiceCommandList cmd_list = new VoiceCommandList();

                /// Other actions

                current_command = cmd_list.Current;
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                /// Error handling
            }
        }
        ```

4.  Register the commands for recognition by setting the command list to the voice control.

    If you want to update registered commands, set the command list again with the updated commands.

    ```
    void set_command()
    {
        try
        {
            VoiceCommandList list = new VoiceCommandList();
            VoiceCommand command = new VoiceCommand();
            command.Command = "test";
            command.Type = CommandType.Foreground;

            list.Add(command);

            VoiceControlClient.SetCommandList(list, CommandType.Foreground);
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            /// Error handling
        }
    }
    ```

5.  When no longer needed, unset the command list:

    ```
    /// Unset the command list
    void unset_command()
    {
        try
        {
            VoiceCommandList list = new VoiceCommandList();
            VoiceCommand command = new VoiceCommand();
            command.Command = "test";
            command.Type = CommandType.Foreground;

            list.Add(command);

            VoiceControlClient.UnsetCommandList(CommandType.Foreground);
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            /// Error handling
        }
    }
    ```
