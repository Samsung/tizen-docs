# Text Input

The text input feature introduces how you can use Input Method Editors (IMEs) and manage your custom keyboards.

You can use the following text input feature in your .NET applications:

-   [Input Method](input-method.md)

    You can create an application that provides a new IME. You can start the IME application life-cycle, interact with the current IME UI state, and retrieve attributes and events.

-   [Input Method Manager](input-method-manager.md)

    You can manage the IMEs installed on the device. The input method manager allows users to enable an installed IME and show the enabled IMEs, and select one as a default keyboard.
