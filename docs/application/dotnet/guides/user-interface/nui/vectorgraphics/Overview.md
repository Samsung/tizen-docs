VectorGraphics APIs are features for vector primitives drawing provided by NUI.
VectorGraphics namespace provides [CanvasView](./CanvasView.md) component and `Shape`, `DrawableGroup`, and `Picture` classes that inherit `Drawable` class.


The following lists the available feature using VectorGraphics:

- [Shape and Stroke](./ShapeAndStroke.md)

  `Shape` is a set of path commands. It can set color, gradient and stroke property.

- [Grouping](./Grouping.md)
