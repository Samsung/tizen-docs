# Personal Data


The personal data features introduce how you can manage secure data related to the user. You can also manage authentication and application usage history data.

You can use the following personal data features in your .NET applications:

-   [Account Management](account.md)

    You can access user accounts and account providers. After getting a specific account, you can manage it, retrieve account information, and manage account secrecy.

-   [Synchronization Management](data-sync.md)

    You can synchronize service application data between a server and the device by creating various sync jobs.

-   [Authentication and Authorization](authentication.md)

    You can obtain an access token by using the OAuth 2.0 authorization. The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables you to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing you to obtain access on your own behalf. You can also use the FIDO Universal Authentication Framework to authenticate users.

-   [Calendar](calendar.md)

    You can manage calendars, events, and tasks on a device. You can add, modify, and monitor calendar items, and set reminders for important items. You can also convert calendar items to the vCalendar format.

-   [Contacts](contacts.md)

    You can manage address books, persons, contacts, and contact groups on a device. You can add, modify, and monitor contacts. You can also convert contacts to the vCard format.

-   [Application Usage History Data](app-history.md)

    You can retrieve the user's application usage patterns, such as information about frequently used applications.
