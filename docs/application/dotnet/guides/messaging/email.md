# Email


You can access the email infrastructure to allow the user to exchange digital messages. Email systems are based on a store-and-forward model, in which email server computer systems accept, forward, deliver, and store messages on behalf of users, who only need to connect to the email infrastructure, typically an email server, with a network-enabled device for the duration of message submission or retrieval.

The main feature of the Tizen.Messaging.Email namespace is email message sending. You can connect to an email server, and compose, save, and [send email messages](#sending) using SMTP.

The Tizen.Messaging.Email namespace can be utilized by any component in the application layer which helps the device user to manage email messaging. For example, the Email methods can be invoked by a multimedia module when the user wants to send a media file through email, or by an email application when the user tries to send an email message.

## Prerequisites

    ```
    var email = new EmailMessage();
    email.Subject = "CSAPI_SUBJECT";
    ```

2.  Create a recipient with an instance of the [Tizen.Messaging.Email.EmailRecipient](https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Messaging.Email.EmailRecipient.html) class, set the recipient address, and add the recipient to the message:

    ```
    var recipient = new EmailRecipient();
    string address = "example@mail.com";

    attachment.FilePath = filepath;
    email.Attachments.Add(attachment);
    ```
