# Applications

A Tizen .NET application is similar to a conventional C\# application, with some additional features optimized for Tizen devices. The additional features have constraints, such as a relatively small screen size and lack of system resources compared to a larger system. For example, for power management reasons, the application can take actions to reduce usage when it finds out that it has its display window covered over by another application window. State change events are delivered to make it possible to detect these situations.
