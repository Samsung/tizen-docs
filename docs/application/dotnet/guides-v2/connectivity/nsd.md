# Network Service Discovery


You can use 2 different protocols to perform network service discoveries to announce local services and search for remote services on a network: DNS-SD (DNS Service Discovery) and SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol).

The main features of the Tizen.Network.Nsd namespace include:

-   Managing local services

    Registering a local service announces it over the network, allowing other devices to find and use it. You can create and [register local services](#registration) through the [Tizen.Network.Nsd.DnssdService](/application/dotnet/api/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Network.Nsd.DnssdService.html) and [Tizen.Network.Nsd.SsdpService](/application/dotnet/api/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Network.Nsd.SsdpService.html) classes, which both implement the [Tizen.Network.Nsd.INsdService](/application/dotnet/api/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Network.Nsd.INsdService.html) interface:

    -   For the DNS-SD services, you can retrieve service details, such as name, type, port number and IP address, through related properties. You can also add a text record after registering the service, and set the key and value of the record. To remove a record, use its key.
    -   For the SSDP services, you can retrieve service details, such as name, target, and URL.
-   Discovering remote services

    You can [search for remote services](#discovery) on the network through the [Tizen.Network.Nsd.DnssdBrowser](/application/dotnet/api/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Network.Nsd.DnssdBrowser.html) and [Tizen.Network.Nsd.SsdpBrowser](/application/dotnet/api/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Network.Nsd.SsdpBrowser.html) classes, which both implement the [Tizen.Network.Nsd.INsdBrowser](/application/dotnet/api/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Network.Nsd.INsdBrowser.html) interface. You can also receive notifications when a service is found by registering an event handler for the `ServiceFound` event of the applicable class.

## Prerequisites

To enable your application to use the network service discovery functionality:

1.  To use the [Tizen.Network.Nsd](/application/dotnet/api/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Network.Nsd.html) namespace, the application has to request permission by adding the following privilege to the `tizen-manifest.xml` file:

    ```XML
    <privileges>
       <privilege>http://tizen.org/privilege/internet</privilege>
    </privileges>
    ```

2.  To make your application visible in Tizen Store only for devices that support the DNS-SD and SSDP protocols, the application must specify the following features in the `tizen-manifest.xml` file:

    ```XML
    <feature name="http://tizen.org/feature/network.service_discovery.dnssd"/>
    <feature name="http://tizen.org/feature/network.service_discovery.ssdp"/>
    ```

3.  To use the methods and properties of the Tizen.Network.Nsd namespace, include it in your application:

    ```csharp
    using Tizen.Network.Nsd;
    ```

## Registering Local Services

To register and deregister a local DNS-SD service:

1.  Register a service by creating a new instance of the [Tizen.Network.Nsd.DnssdService](/application/dotnet/api/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Network.Nsd.DnssdService.html) class and using its `RegisterService()` method:

    ```csharp
    /// Register service
    INsdService service = new DnssdService("_http._tcp");
    DnssdService dnssdService = (DnssdService)service;
    dnssdService.RegisterService();
    ```

2.  Deregister the service by using the `DeregisterService()` method.

    When the `Tizen.Network.Nsd.DnssdService` class instance is no longer needed, destroy it with the `Dispose()` method.

    ```csharp
    /// Deregister service
    dnssdService.DeregisterService();
    dnssdService.Dispose();
    ```

## Discovering Remote Services

To discover remote DNS-SD services:

1.  Start discovery by creating a new instance of the [Tizen.Network.Nsd.DnssdBrowser](/application/dotnet/api/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Network.Nsd.DnssdBrowser.html) class and using its `StartDiscovery()` method:

    ```csharp
    /// Start discovery
    INsdBrowser browser = new DnssdBrowser("_http._tcp");
    DnssdBrowser dnssdBrowser = (DnssdBrowser)browser;
    dnssdBrowser.StartDiscovery();
    ```

2.  When you have found the services you need, stop discovery by using the `StopDiscovery()` method.

    When the `Tizen.Network.Nsd.DnssdBrowser` class instance is no longer needed, destroy it with the `Dispose()` method.

    ```csharp
    /// Stop discovery
    dnssdBrowser.StopDiscovery();
    dnssdBrowser.Dispose();
    ```
