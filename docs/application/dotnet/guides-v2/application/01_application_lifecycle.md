# Application Lifecycle

The Tizen .NET application model handles application life-cycle and system events. Tizen .NET application life-cycle is handled by the [Tizen.Applications](/application/dotnet/api/TizenFX/latest/api/Tizen.Applications.html) namespace. 
It provides methods to manage the main event loop, the application state change events, and basic system events. Applications in the same package follow the same installation life-cycle, which is handled by the application package manager. 
Each application in the package follows its own application life-cycle. Each application in an application package can be identified by its own ID.

## Tizen .NET Application State Change Methods

The following example shows the basic usage of the lifecycle events provided by the `NUIApplication` class derived from the `CoreApplication` and `Application`. To use the `NUIApplication` class `Tizen.NUI` namespace have to be included in the project. In example below two additional namespaces are used: `Tizen.NUI.BaseComponents` for the `TextLabel` component and `Tizen.Sensor` for the accelerometer access. The application shows reason of overriding `OnPause` and `OnResume` methods. The app suspends `Accelerometer` update callback to save power in the `Paused` state. 

```csharp
using Tizen.NUI;
using Tizen.NUI.BaseComponents;
using Tizen.Sensor;
```

All .NET application defines own namespace. In this case `lifecycle` namespace is used.

```csharp
namespace lifecycle
{
``` 

Main class of the application defined as `Program`. In this case the `Program` class derives from the `NUIApplication` object. The `Accelerometer` handle is declared in the main class to use it in all lifecycle callbacks. `OnCreate()` method use `Tizen.Log.Info` to print information in `dlogutil` tool. To get more information about logging system in the `Tizen` please check [Log Viewer](/application/vstools/tools/logs_viewer.md). `OnCreate()` method initializes the UI and the `Accelerometer` component. 

```csharp
    class Program : NUIApplication
    {
        private Accelerometer SensorAccelerometer = null;

        protected override void OnCreate()
        {
            Tizen.Log.Info("LifecycleTest", "OnCreate()");
            base.OnCreate();
            InitSensors();
            InitUI();
        }
```

Following code snippet is responsible for initialize `Accelerometer` sensor. Function setups the event handler for data update and set the update interval for one second. After setup the `SensorAccelerometer.Start()` to start measurements. 

```csharp
        void InitSensors()
        {
            SensorAccelerometer = new Accelerometer();
            SensorAccelerometer.Interval = 1000;
            SensorAccelerometer.DataUpdated += OnAccelerometer;
            SensorAccelerometer.Start();
        }
```

UI setup is based on basic template. Only one `TextLabel` component is used to show the application UI and its running state.
```csharp
        void InitUI()
        {
            Window.Instance.KeyEvent += OnKeyEvent;

            TextLabel test = new TextLabel("Lifecycle test...")
            {
                HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center,
                VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center,
                TextColor = Color.Blue,
                PointSize = 12.0f,
                HeightResizePolicy = ResizePolicyType.FillToParent,
                WidthResizePolicy = ResizePolicyType.FillToParent
            };

            Window.Instance.GetDefaultLayer().Add(test);
        }
```

`OnTerminate()` method logs information about the application termination. 

```csharp
        protected override void OnTerminate()
        {
            Tizen.Log.Info("LifecycleTest", "OnTerminate()");
            base.OnTerminate();
        }
```

`OnPause()` method is called when application is suspended but not killed. Then it goes into the `Paused` state. To stop reading data from the `Accelerometer`, `SensorAccelerometer.Stop()` method is used. Now the application reduces resource usage. The main application window goes now into the background. UI events are not received but the data event handler have to be stopped manually.

```csharp
        protected override void OnPause()
        {
            Tizen.Log.Info("LifecycleTest", "OnPause()");
            base.OnPause();

            if (SensorAccelerometer != null) SensorAccelerometer.Stop();
        }
```

The `Tizen` operating system may resume `Lifecycle` application if it not was terminated. Data updating is restored using the `SensorAccelerometer.Start()` method. The application main window now should be visible. 

```csharp
        protected override void OnResume()
        {
            Tizen.Log.Info("LifecycleTest", "OnResume()");
            base.OnResume();       

            if (SensorAccelerometer != null) SensorAccelerometer.Start();
        }
```

The callback setup in function `InitSensors()` is called every one second. It prints debug information about a measured data from `Accelerometer` sensor. In the emulator case this values can be changed using `Control Panel` tool. For details please check [Log Viewer](/application/dotnet/guides/sensors/device-sensors.md)

```csharp
        void OnAccelerometer(object sender, AccelerometerDataUpdatedEventArgs args)
        {
            Tizen.Log.Info("LifecycleTest", string.Format("X: {0}, Y: {1}, Z: {2}", args.X, args.Y, args.Z));
        }
```

To terminate the application `OnKeyEvent()` handler is implemented. When the back key is pressed `Exit()` method is called to terminate the application. To minimize the application the `Home` button should be pressed which is handled by the `Tizen` operating system. Then the `OnPause()` method will be called.

```csharp        
        public void OnKeyEvent(object sender, Window.KeyEventArgs e)
        {
            if (e.Key.State == Key.StateType.Down && (e.Key.KeyPressedName == "XF86Back" || e.Key.KeyPressedName == "Escape"))
            {
                Exit();
            }
        }
```

The `Main` function code creates the `Program` instance and calls `Run` method to change application state to `Running` and call `OnCreate()` callback.

```csharp
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var app = new Program();
            app.Run(args);
        }
    }
}
```

Following screenshot presents dump from the dlogutil tool. Data read is stopped when application changes state to `Paused`.

A Tizen .NET application can be in one of several different states.  Typically, the application is launched by the user from the Launcher, or by another application. When the application is starting, the `OnCreate()` method is executed and the main event loop starts. The application is normally at the top of the window, with focus.

When the application loses the focus status, the `OnPause()` method is invoked. The application can go into the pause state, which means that your application is not terminated but continues to run in the background, when:

- A new application is launched by the request of your application.
- The user requests to go to the home screen.
- A system event (such as an incoming phone call) occurs and causes a resident application with a higher priority to become active and temporarily hide your application.
- An alarm is triggered for another application, which becomes the topmost window and hides your application.

The application in the background goes into a suspended state. In the suspended state, the application process is executed with limited CPU resources. In other words, the platform does not allow the running of background applications, except for some exceptional applications (such as Media and Download) that necessarily work in the background. In this case, you can [define a background category in the application manifest file](./uiapplication/ui-app.md#allow_bg), to prevent the application from going into the suspended state.

When your application becomes visible again, the `OnResume()` method is invoked. The visibility returns, when:

- Another application requests your application to run (for example, the Task Navigator, which shows all running applications and lets the user select any application to run).
- All applications on top of your application in the window stack finish.
- An alarm is triggered for your application, bringing it to the front and hiding other applications.

When your application starts exiting, the `OnTerminate()` method is invoked. Your application can start the termination process, when:

- Your application itself requests to exit by calling the `Exit()` method to terminate the event loop.
- The low memory killer is killing your application in a low memory situation.

The following figure shows the UI application states.

Application state changes are managed by the underlying framework. For
