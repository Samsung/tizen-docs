# Inspiring Metaphors

Gear apps can use round objects from daily life as a design metaphor. Users recall familiar experiences as they interact with an app. Metaphors can also guide how users control the bezel.

For example, the bezel's rotation can be associated with turning a steering wheel, and the dial-style app list intuitively guides users to rotate the bezel. Carefully observe circular objects around you for inspiration.
