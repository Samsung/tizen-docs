# Apps

The apps screen contains all the apps installed on the Gear. Users can access, rearrange, or delete them from this screen.

## App screen

The app screen shows the icons and titles of all apps installed on Gear, so take their appearance into consideration when you’re designing your own app icon and refer to [Visual design](../visual-design/colors.html#theme_colors) for more details.

 

## App management

Apps can be downloaded through the Samsung Gear app on the user's mobile phone or Get more apps in the app list. Apps can be rearranged or uninstalled in the edit mode that opens when users touch and hold an app’s icon or title.

 

## Get more apps

The Get more apps icon appears at the end of the app list and recommends apps of interest that can be downloaded without connecting to a phone. Since this feature shows a recommended app’s icon that fills the whole screen, you may want to design an alternate icon for your app to cover this use case. Get more apps uses the app icon that you submit when registering your app with the Seller Office site, not the one in the APK.
