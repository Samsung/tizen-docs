# Search

Search is provided through More options or a search icon at the top of the screen.

## Search suggestions

Search suggestions should appear as the user types. For example, if the user searches for *John* in the contact list, the app finds all contacts that contain the same name.

-   **Data-based search suggestions**

    Data-based search suggestions recommend search words based on the user’s app data.

-   **History-based search suggestions**

    History-based search suggestions recommend search words based on the user’s search history.
