# Continuing Activities on Phone


Some tasks are difficult to complete on the Gear, so the Gear allows users to continue these on a paired device. You can provide this feature through More options, the bottom button in a screen where a given task is included, or a notification. This feature is also recommended when a number of complicated steps are involved in a task or when your app asks for permission that can only be granted on a phone. Typically any task that requires a user to enter a lot of text, like creating a user account or registering a credit or debit card, should be done on a phone.
