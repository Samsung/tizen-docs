# Permissions

Permission pages ask for permission from the user to launch an app or execute certain features, and should be easy to understand. For example, if your app lets users share their location, you may need permission to collect location data before this feature is used for the first time.

-   **Ask before running your app** when permission is obviously needed and required.
-   **Ask in context** when permission is only needed to run specific functions of your app.

*Permissions pages appear as a confirmation pop-up so users can agree or disagree.*

## Elements

Permission pages should include:

-   **Messages**

    These should be clear for users to understand what they are permitting.

-   **Actions**

    Tapping the tick on the right hand side gives permission and activates the app or the function. Tapping the X closes the app or blocks the function.

-   **Don't ask again checkbox**

    You can ask users if their permission should apply every time they open the app. If users select the *Don’t ask again* checkbox, the page won’t appear again.

>**Tip**  
>If you need to ask permission for a number of functions, show the permissions in sequence.
