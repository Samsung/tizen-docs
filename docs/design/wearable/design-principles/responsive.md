# Responsive


The Gear should immediately respond to user input. Responsive designs give users confidence in the Gear and a greater sense of control.Â 

## 1. Provide natural and responsive feedback



Your app should provide immediate feedback as a natural response to user input by using visual, sound, and haptic responses. Avoid non-essential screens that require additional user interactions to allow users to complete tasks quickly and conveniently.

## 2. Make your components easy to use



Adequately sized on-screen UI elements make interacting with your app easier. It can be difficult to use the Gear if buttons are too small or components take up too much screen space.

*Components are relatively large so users can touch them easily.*
