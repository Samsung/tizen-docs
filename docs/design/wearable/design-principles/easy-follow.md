# Easy to follow



Users should be able to control the Gear quickly and conveniently. Avoid making it complicated for users to complete their task. Consistent, meaningful, and intuitive designs help users navigate pages and orient themselves within your app.

## 1. Suggest interactions intuitively



Intuitive and meaningful connections between interactions and components on the screen can help users better understand the information and its context. Consider bezel control when designing your interface, as it should suggest how users should use the bezel to navigate and interact.

## 2. Keep a consistent theme



Deliver a consistent user experience throughout your app by maintaining visual continuity. Your screens should have a consistent layout, brand color, and font. Give your app one common theme that represents the content it provides.
