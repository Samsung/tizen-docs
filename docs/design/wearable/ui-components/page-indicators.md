# Page Indicators

Page indicators show the number of pages in a series and indicate which page is currently being displayed.

## Usage

Page indicators are presented at the top of the screen as dots that represent each page. There are 2 types of page indicator available, depending on whether the pages can be navigated with a rotary action or not.

## Behavior

-   **Focus**

    Page indicators are presented as dots. Each dot represents one page in a series. When users rotate the bezel or swipe the screen, the focus shifts to the next or previous dot.

-   **Linking multiple pages to the middle dot**

    Page indicators can use up to 20 dots. If you have more than 20 pages in a series, multiple pages will be represented by the 11th dot in the middle, which will stay in focus until all linked pages are scrolled through.

## Types

-   **Circular page indicators**

    These indicators curve around the top edge of the screen when the pages are navigated by a rotary action and a swipe. They can form an arc of up to 120 degrees and are center-aligned.

    *Circular page indicators are provided when both the rotary action and swiping are available for page navigation.*


-   **Linear page indicators**

    These indicators form a horizontal line at the top edge of the screen when navigation is through swiping only. This type of indicator is recommended when the rotary action controls other functions and canâ€™t be used for page navigation.
