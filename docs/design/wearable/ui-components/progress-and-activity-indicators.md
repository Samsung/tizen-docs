# Progress and Activity Indicators



Indicators visually show that a task is ongoing. Using a progress or activity indicator will depend on if you can determine the amount of time a user will be waiting.

## Usage

Use indicators to show the progress of data loading or other similar tasks.

## Behavior

-   **Filling**

    A progress indicator will gradually fill up according to the level of progress made.

-   **Spinning**

    An activity indicator will spin until an activity is completed.

## Types

-   **Progress indicators**

    A progress indicator helps users determine how long theyâ€™ll be waiting by displaying how far a task has progressed. You can show progress with a percentage scale or a fraction indicator. The indicator will disappear when the task is completed.
