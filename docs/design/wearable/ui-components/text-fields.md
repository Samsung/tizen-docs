# Text Fields

Text fields are used to input text.

 

|Text field|          |
|----------|----------|
|**Native**|Entry     |
|**Web**   |-         |

## Usage

-   **Limit text input to one line**

    Direct users to their phone when they need to enter something longer.

-   **Only use text fields when other options are not available**

    Instead, encourage the use of voice input or display a list of pre-defined options for users to choose from.

## Behavior

-   **Input**

    Tapping on a text field pulls up the keyboard from the bottom of the screen. Users finish inputting by tapping the Done button or swiping down from the bezel.

-   **Keyboard**

    You can define the input type of a text field to ensure the appropriate keyboard is launched. Keyboards have default, numeric, e-mail, or URL formats. You can also assign different functions to the Return key such as Done, Search, and Send.

## Elements

-   **Field**

    The field receives the user’s text input. When tapped, it displays a cursor and pulls up the keyboard.

-   **Hint text (optional)**

    Hint text explains what users should type in the text input field or shows an example. You can provide guide text on an empty field before users start typing or after they’ve cleared all text. It automatically disappears when users begin typing.

-   **Clear text button (optional)**

    A clear text button erases all the text in the field. It should be placed at the right of the input field.

-   **Remove field button (optional)**

    A remove field button deletes the entire input field. It should be placed at the right of the input field. When you provide a remove field button, give users the chance to add it back if they want.
