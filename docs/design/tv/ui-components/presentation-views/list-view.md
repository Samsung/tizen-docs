# List View

A list view is used to show multiple text-based items that belong to the same category.

A list item can be in either of the following states:

-   Normal
-   Focused
-   Selected
-   Disabled



The following guidelines apply to list items:

-   List items can contain a label, an icon, or both.
-   The label is limited to 1 line of text.
-   If the label length exceeds the text area, the excess characters are replaced with an ellipsis (...).
