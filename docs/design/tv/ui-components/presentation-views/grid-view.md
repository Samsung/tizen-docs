# Grid View

A grid view is used to display graphical content. It consists of grid items and optional labels. The grid items can optionally have additional information.

A grid item can be in either of the following states:

-   Normal
-   Focused
-   Selected
-   Disabled



The following guidelines apply to grid items:

-   The grid item displays only graphical items, such as icons and images.
-   If the label length exceeds the text area, the excess characters are replaced with an ellipsis (...).
-   If available, additional information is shown over the grid item.
