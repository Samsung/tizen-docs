# Radio Button

Radio buttons are used when the user can select only 1 option from multiple options. A radio button can have a label. The radio mark appears when the option is selected.



A radio button can be in either of the following states:

- Unselected
- Selected
- Focused
- Disabled


The following guidelines apply to radio buttons:

- When 1 option is selected, the other options are automatically unselected.
- The label is always located to the right of the radio button.
