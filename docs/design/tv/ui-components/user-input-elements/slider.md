# Slider

Sliders are used to adjust a value within a certain range. A slider is displayed as a bar, which consists of a track and values. It can also have a handler, additional text, and an icon, if necessary.



A slider can be in either of the following states:

-   Normal
-   Focused
-   Disabled
