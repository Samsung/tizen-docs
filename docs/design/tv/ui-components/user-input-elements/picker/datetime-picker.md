# Date&Time Picker

Date&time pickers are used to set date or time values, and they are displayed as a group of pickers.



There are 2 types of date&time pickers:

-   The date picker is used to set date values. It consists of a day, a month, and a year picker.
-   The time picker is used to set time values. It consists of an hour, a minute, and an am/pm picker (only in 12-hour format).
