# Back Key Information

When the user presses the **Back** key on the remote control, there are 2 possible actions to be taken. Consequently, the **Back** key information shown on the screen must also provide the correct information based on the action possible on the current screen:

- Quit action: This information is shown when the focus is on the first item in the full screen. It means that a quit popup appears if the user presses the **Back** key.
- Front action: This information is shown when the focus is not on the first item in the full screen. It means that the focus moves to the first item if the user presses the **Back** key.
