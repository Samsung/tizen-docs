# Simplicity

Using many decorative elements on the screen at the same time can
confuse and distract the user.

Simplify your application design to allow the user to clearly identify the content:

-   [Use circular icons](simplicity/circular-icons.md)
-   [Hide inactive icons](simplicity/hidden-inactive-icons.md)
-   [Avoid unnecessary    decorations](simplicity/no-unnecessary-decorations.md)
