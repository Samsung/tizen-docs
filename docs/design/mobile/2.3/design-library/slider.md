# Slider

The slider is used to control a value by moving the handle horizontally.

Use a slider for a setting with a wide range or when to show the direct effect of the change to the user. Sliders can be used to adjust brightness, color value, media playback, and volume.

If the user must set an exact numeric value, consider using other controls, such as a picker.

Never combine sliders with arbitrary numeric values that do not provide the user with meaningful information. For example, do not write out the low and high numeric value for a volume slider.
