# Terminology

There are 2 important UX design features that help application users read and better understand application-related controls and events: a recognizable font and standard terminology.

To make the text legible and easy to understand, you must select the shape, size, and color of the text font, as well as the application background color. In addition, the use of appropriate graphic design enhances text legibility.

> **NOTE**  
> By default, Tizen displays text from left to right. However, certain languages, such as Arabic, are displayed from right to left.

Using action-related labels consistently in your application keeps the user experience consistent. Use the following terms:

-   **Create**: Use for creating a new item, for example, "Create memo" or "Create alarm".
-   **Done**: Use for exiting the application.
-   **Send:** Use when sending a message.

Use a positive tone of voice for any messaging or labels in your application. Avoid using emphatic words or words with negative connotations.

The language tone should provide users with the impression that they use a capable and powerful phone that is reliable and good to own. Using negative words affects the user’s perception of the phone.

 

**Table: Phrasing for general actions**

| AVOID                                | PREFER                               |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Cannot complete request              | Unable to complete request           |
| Network failed                       | Network unavailable                  |
| Synchronization started              | Synchronizing…                       |
| Organizer not accessible             | Organizer is unavailable             |



Never use phrasing that blames users or makes them feel at fault. Instead, your language and tone should support the users´ view of the device as an extension of themselves. Do not use language that identifies the user as being separate from the phone. If there is a problem in performing a task, use messaging that downplays the user's role in the situation.

Always keep in mind that it takes time for a user to read text. Since important text messages are shown to the user at points where user interaction is interrupted (for example, in a pop-up, information or warning note, or dialog box), keep your messages short, to the point, and comprehensible.

If your application messages are too long to be displayed in a single line, apply the following principles:

-   Reduce the font size but make sure you stay within the limitations of the Tizen UI guidelines.
-   If the message length increases after language translation, you can use appropriate abbreviations for the translated language. Always have a language expert verify your translations.
-   To adjust the message length within a fixed space, you can cut the start, middle, or end of a sentence and replace it with an ellipsis ('…'). However, only use this approach in exceptional circumstances.
