# UI Components for Tizen App Design



This chapter provides information about the basic UI components in the Tizen SDK. You can include these components in your app designs to implement specific features.

 

Tizen UI components may be divided into four categories:

-   [Navigation elements](ui-components/navigation-elements.md) are used to browse content and switch between screens.
-   [Presentation views](ui-components/presentation-views.md) are used to display the main content of an app in different forms.
-   [User input elements](ui-components/user-input-components.md) are used to collect user input for specific tasks.
-   [Assist views](ui-components/assist-views.md) are used to provide additional information.
