# Gestures

The Tizen platform supports a wide variety of gestures that allow users to directly access content on touch screen devices. For example, users can tap the screen to select an element, swipe to scroll through content on the screen, or drag and drop an element to move it.

When you design your apps, make sure you match the gestures in your app with those provided by the Tizen platform. This ensures consistent user experience, especially when multiple apps are running at the same time. The following lists guidelines for designing new gestures for your apps.

> -   DO NOT use the basic touch gestures defined in this guideline for different actions.
> -   DO NOT assign custom gestures for the basic actions that already have common gestures assigned to them.



The basic touch gestures provided with the Tizen SDK will work just fine with most of the apps you design. However, if you are designing unique apps such as games, you may want to invent more creative touch interactions.

Also, provide appropriate feedback for all interactions to make your app responsive.

The following table lists the basic Tizen gestures you can use to offer intuitive touch interactions.
