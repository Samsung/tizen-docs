The media content and metadata features introduce how you can handle media content and its metadata in your application. You can manage and search for various media content on the device, such as media files, bookmarks, albums, and playlists. You can also access the MIME type information, and extract and edit the metadata of the media files.

You can use the following media content and metadata features in your native applications:

- [Media Content](media-content-n.md)

  You can update database details due to file (or folder) creation or deletion. If a received file (or folder) does not exist in the file system, it is removed from the database. You can also retrieve a list of media folders, retrieve a list of media items, and monitor changes in the media database. You can search for specific media folders and read their information, and retrieve media folder content.
