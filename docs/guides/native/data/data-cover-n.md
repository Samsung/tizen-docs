# Data Storage and Management
## Dependencies
- Tizen 2.4 and Higher for Mobile
- Tizen 2.3.1 and Higher for Wearable

The data storage and management features introduce how you can manage the data stored on the device. They describe the file systems and how you can access and handle the data.

You can use the following data storage and management features in your native applications:

- [Data Storages](data-storages-n.md)
You can retrieve storage information and manage directories. The accessible parts of the file system are represented as virtual root locations, which form a collection of locations that function as a single virtual device file system.

- [SQLite Database Engine](sql-n.md)
You can access SQLite and OpenSSL open source modules. They enable you to store application data in a database, and encrypt it for protection.
