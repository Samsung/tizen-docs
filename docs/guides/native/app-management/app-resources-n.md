# Application Resources
## Dependencies
- Tizen 2.4 and Higher for Mobile
- Tizen 3.0 and Higher for Wearable

You can get or set common resources for multiple devices with different specifications.

The main features of the Resource Manager API include:

- Setting resources

  You can [set resources](#set) for your application in the **Resource Manager** view in the Tizen Studio. By setting specific resources for specific languages and screen resolutions, you ensure that the application works flawlessly on multiple devices.

  **Note**
  The Resource Manager tool is supported since Tizen 2.4.If you cannot access the `Resource Manager` view in the Tizen Studio, check the version and API version attributes in the `<manifest>` element of the application manifest file.For more information on the Resource Manager tool, see [Providing Resources for Multiple Device Types](../../../../org.tizen.studio/html/native_tools/resource_manager_n.htm).

- Using the resources

  You can use different resources (such as images, layouts, and sounds) between devices with different device specifications. For example:

  - To set a different button image for an application depending on the device's current language setting, use the `app_resource_manager_get()` function to [get the appropriate resource file path](#get_path).
  - To use different images depending on the device's screen resolution (DPI), use the same `app_resource_manager_get()` function to get the appropriate image file path.

- Testing the resources

  You can [test the different resources by running them in the emulator](#check_resource).

  **Note**
  The resource files must be set to be in different folders and have the same filename.

## Prerequisites

To use the functions and resource types of the Resource Manager API (in [mobile](../../../../org.tizen.native.mobile.apireference/group__CAPI__RESOURCE__MANAGER__MODULE.html) and [wearable](../../../../org.tizen.native.wearable.apireference/group__CAPI__RESOURCE__MANAGER__MODULE.html) applications), include the `<app_resource_manager.h>` header file in your application:

```
#include <app_resource_manager.h>
```

## Setting Resources Using the Resource Manager Tool

To set the resources:

1. To activate the **Resource Manager** view content in the Tizen Studio, select the project in the **Project Explorer** view.![Show view](./media/resource_manager_show_view2.png)If the **Resource Manager** view is not visible, open it: in the Tizen Studio menu, go to **Window > Show View > Resource Manager**.

2. To open the **Resource Configuration Dialog** window, click the ![Resource Manager configuration icon](./media/resource_manager_config_icon.png) icon in the **Resource Manager** view toolbar menu.

3. To add resource directories for the required languages and screen resolutions, select them in the **Language** and **DPI** drop-down menus, and click **Add**.The resource directory hierarchy is created.![Resource configuration dialog](./media/resource_manager_config.png)

4. To add images in the created resource directory, copy them directly to the resource directories.

   ![Add images](./media/resource_manager_add_images.png) ![Image files for variants](./media/resource_manager_image_files.png)

   **Note**
   The file names of the resources that you want to use interchangeably depending on the device conditions must be the same.

   â€‹

5. To view the resource directories, use the `res.xml` file.The Tizen Studio creates the `res.xml` file automatically when you build the application package.![res.xml file](./media/resource_manager_res_xml.png)

## Getting the Resource File Path

To get the appropriate resource file path in your code:

1. Create the resource manager using the `app_resource_manager_init()` function.
```
app_resource_manager_init();
```
If the function returns `APP_RESOURCE_ERROR_NONE`, the resource manager has been successfully created.

2. Get the resource path using the `app_resource_manager_get()` function. You need 2 parameters:
	- Resource ID
	The resource ID is an identifier for a specific resource. It consists of subdirectories and filenames including its extension. The same resources are located in different locations with the same filename for supporting multiple devices.

    - Resource type
    The resource type defines whether the resource is an image, layout, sound, or some other file type. There are 4 resource types, which are defined in the `app_resource_e` enumerator (in [mobile](../../../../org.tizen.native.mobile.apireference/group__CAPI__RESOURCE__MANAGER__MODULE.html#ga83dadea23a885e1eb257ad1f115513e9) and [wearable](../../../../org.tizen.native.wearable.apireference/group__CAPI__RESOURCE__MANAGER__MODULE.html#ga83dadea23a885e1eb257ad1f115513e9) applications).Resources with the same resource type are grouped as a folder. The folder name is irrelevant to the actual resource type within it.

    ```
    Evas_Object *img
    char *img_path = NULL;

    app_resource_manager_get(APP_RESOURCE_TYPE_IMAGE, "flag.png", &img_path);

    Evas* canvas = evas_object_evas_get(ad->conform);
    img = evas_object_image_filled_add(canvas);

    if (img_path != NULL) {
        evas_object_image_file_set(img, img_path, NULL);

        evas_object_move(img, 50, 50);
        evas_object_resize(img, 300, 200);
        evas_object_show(img);
        free(img_path);
    }
    ```

    If the function returns `APP_RESOURCE_ERROR_NONE`, the resource path has been successfully retrieved.

3. When you no longer need to get the resource path, call the `app_resource_manager_release()` function to release the resource manager instance.The resource manager instance must be released only when the application is closing, so this function must be called in the `app_terminate()` callback function.
```
static void
app_terminate(void *data)
{
    app_resource_manager_release();
}
```

## Checking Resources with the Emulator Manager

To check how the resources are shown on different device configurations, create emulator instances with different resolutions with the [Emulator Manager](../../../../org.tizen.studio/html/common_tools/emulator_manager.htm) and run the application on the instances using different language settings:

1. Open the Emulator Manager from the **Connection Explorer** view in the Tizen Studio.![Connection Explorer buttons](./media/resource_manager_conn_explorer.png)If the **Connection Explorer** view is not visible, open it: in the Tizen Studio menu, go to **Window > Show View > Connection Explorer** or **Window > Show View > Other > Tizen > Connection Explorer**.

2. In the **Emulator Manager** window, the HD Mobile emulator has already been created.Next, create an emulator instance with a WVGA resolution by clicking **Create**.![Create a new emulator](./media/resource_manager_emulator_new.png)Select mobile, and the **WVGA Mobile** template. Click **Finish**. If the HD Mobile emulator has not been created, create it as well. For more information on creating an emulator instance, see [Creating Emulator Instances](../../../../org.tizen.studio/html/common_tools/emulator_manager.htm#create).

3. Run the application on the WVGA Mobile device emulator:

   1. In the **Emulator Manager** window, select the **WVGA Mobile** emulator and click **Launch**.The WVGA Mobile device emulator starts.![Start the emulator](./media/resource_manager_emulator_run.png)![Emulator running](./media/resource_manager_emulator_running.png)
   2. In the **Project Explorer** view in the Tizen Studio, right-click the application and select **Run As > Tizen Native Application**.The application launches on the emulator.![Application running on the emulator](./media/resource_manager_emulator_run_us_en.png)
   3. To close the emulator, right-click it and select **Close**.

4. Run the application on the HD Mobile device emulator:

   1. In the **Emulator Manager** window, select the **HD Mobile** emulator and click **Launch**.The HD Mobile device emulator starts.![Start the emulator](./media/resource_manager_emulator_run_hd.png)![Emulator running](./media/resource_manager_emulator_running_hd.png)
   2. In the **Project Explorer** view in the Tizen Studio, right-click the application and select **Run As > Tizen Native Application**.The application launches on the emulator, and you can see that a different image is displayed depending on the device display resolution.![Application running on the emulator](./media/resource_manager_emulator_run_hd_us_en.png)

5. If you change the emulator language settings and run the application again, you can also see that a different image is displayed depending on the device language (in this case, US English and Korean).
