The authentication and authorization features introduce how you can obtain access tokens using OAuth 2.0, and authenticate users using the FIDO framework.

You can use the following authentication and authorization features in your native applications:

- [FIDO Universal Authentication Framework](fido-n.md)
You can use the FIDO Universal Authentication Framework to authenticate users. FIDO covers password-less authentications, such as fingerprint, iris, and voice.

- [OAuth 2.0](oauth-n.md)
You can obtain an access token by using the OAuth 2.0 authorization. The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables you to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing you to obtain access on your own behalf.
