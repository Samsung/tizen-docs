# Graphics
## Dependencies
- Tizen 2.4 and Higher for Mobile
- Tizen 2.3.1 and Higher for Wearable

The graphics features introduce how you can improve the visual look of your application through efficient use of images. You can handle graphics using various graphic libraries and interfaces, such as Cairo and OpenGL® ES. You can also improve the performance of your graphic application with hardware acceleration.

You can use the following graphics features in your native applications:

- [Cairo Vector Graphics](cairo-n.md)
You can use Cairo to draw on the image surface and Evas objects to get the image data. Cairo provides powerful drawing operations to create a graphical experience that you desire, including stroking, filling, compositing images, and any affine transforms (such as scale, rotation, and shear).

- [Graphic Buffer and Surface](graphic-buffer-n.md)
The Tizen Buffer Manager (TBM) surface is used to handle the graphic buffer in Tizen. TBM provides the abstraction interface for the graphic buffer and the user interface for the TBM surface. It supports the RGB and YUV graphic formats, as well as multiple plane graphic buffers.

- [Hardware Acceleration](hw-acceleration-n.md)
You can enable hardware acceleration for the application. When the hardware acceleration is active, it increases rendering performance and allows you to use OpenGL® ES smoothly.

- [OpenGL® ES](opengl-n.md)
You can create OpenGL® ES applications in Tizen with the EGL™ layer. Tizen native applications can use OpenGL® ES not only for creating a 3D scene but also for a 2D scene that requires fast interaction. OpenGL® ES is also good for improving performance and reducing power consumption when the native application performs computation-intensive tasks that can be run in parallel.

- [Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)](sdl-n.md)
Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) is a cross-platform development library designed to provide a low-level hardware abstraction layer to computer multimedia hardware components. You can get high-efficiency access to graphics and computing on modern GPUs with Vulkan® or OpenGL® ES. You can use cutting-edge 3D programming tools to create high-quality games and real-time graphics in your applications.
