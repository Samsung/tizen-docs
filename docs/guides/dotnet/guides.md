TizenFX API Guides
==================

## Dependencies

- Tizen 4.0 and Higher

Tizen .NET provides a rich set of interfaces allowing you to build
compelling TV, mobile, and wearable applications which achieve native
performance.

The TizenFX API allows applications to call into platform-specific
functionality from the shared code. This functionality enables
Xamarin.Forms applications to do things a native application can do,
without causing the portable part of the application to become littered
with operating system-specific details.
