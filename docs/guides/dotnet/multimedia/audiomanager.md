Audio Management
================

## Dependencies

- Tizen 4.0 and Higher

You can control the audio behavior of your application.

The main features of the `Tizen.Multimedia.AudioManager` class include:

-   Controlling the volume

    You can [control the output volume](#manage) by managing the audio
    type and its volume level.

- Querying audio devices

    You can [retrieve various device information](#query_device), such
    as the device state.


Prerequisites
-------------

To control volume levels, the application has to request permission by
adding the following privilege to the `tizen-manifest.xml` file:

``` {.prettyprint}
<privileges>
   <privilege>http://tizen.org/privilege/volume.set</privilege>
</privileges>
```


Controlling Volume Levels <a id="manage"></a>
-------------------------

You can manage the volume level of a specific audio type. You can set
and get a volume level and a maximum volume level of a particular audio
type.

Normally, if there is an active output stream, the
`VolumeController.CurrentPlaybackType` property of the
[Tizen.Multimedia.AudioManager](https://developer.tizen.org/dev-guide/csapi/classTizen_1_1Multimedia_1_1AudioManager.html)
class returns the stream audio type, and if not, it returns
`AudioVolumeType.None`.

To control the volume of your application:

-   To receive a notification whenever the volume changes, define and
    register an event handler for the `VolumeController.Changed` event
    of the `Tizen.Multimedia.AudioManager` class:

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    void OnVolumeChanged(object sender, VolumeChangedEventArgs args)
    {
        Tizen.Log.Info("AudioManager", $"{args.Type} volume changed to {args.Level}");
    }

    AudioManager.VolumeController.Changed += OnVolumeChanged;
    ```

    When the volume changes, the event handler provides in its
    parameters the audio type that has changed and the new volume level.

- To retrieve the current and maximum volumes for a specific audio
    type, use the `VolumeController.Level` and
    `VolumeController.MaxLevel` properties of the
    `Tizen.Multimedia.AudioManager` class:

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    var type = AudioVolumeType.Media;

    var curVol = AudioManager.VolumeController.Level[type];

    var maxVol = AudioManager.VolumeController.MaxLevel[type];
    ```

- To set the volume level, use the `VolumeController.Level` property.

    In the following example, a value is received from application UI
    slider, with which the user sets the volume level.

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    var type = AudioVolumeType.Media;
    int value;

    /// Make sure the value is within the system maximum volume
    /// by checking the VolumeController.MaxLevel property

    AudioManager.VolumeController.Level[type] = value;
    ```


Querying Audio Devices<a id="query_device"></a> 
----------------------

The audio behavior of your application must change depending on the
audio devices that are connected.

To query audio device information:

-   To access device information:
    1.  Retrieve the list of the currently connected audio devices with
        the `GetConnectedDevices()` method of the
        [Tizen.Multimedia.AudioManager](https://developer.tizen.org/dev-guide/csapi/classTizen_1_1Multimedia_1_1AudioManager.html)
        class:

        ``` {.prettyprint}
        IEnumerable<AudioDevice> connectedDevices = AudioManager.GetConnectedDevices();
        ```

    2. Retrieve the device information from the
        [Tizen.Multimedia.AudioDevice](https://developer.tizen.org/dev-guide/csapi/classTizen_1_1Multimedia_1_1AudioDevice.html)
        class, which has the following properties:
        -   `Type`: Device type
        -   `IoDirection`: Device IO direction
        -   `Id`: Device ID
        -   `Name`: Device name
        -   `State`: Device state

- To get a notification when the audio device connection or state
    changes, add event handlers for the `DeviceConnectionChanged` and
    `DeviceStateChanged` events of the `Tizen.Multimedia.AudioManager`
    class:
    -   To receive a notification whenever the device connection state
        changes:

        ``` {.prettyprint}
        void OnDeviceConnectionChanged(object sender, AudioDeviceConnectionChangedEventArgs args)
        {
            if (args.IsConnected)
            {
                if (args.Device.Type == AudioDeviceType.BluetoothMedia)
                    /// Connected device type is Bluetooth, handle accordingly
                else
                    /// Handle accordingly
            }
            else
            {
                if (args.Device.Type == AudioDeviceType.BluetoothMedia)
                    /// Disconnected device type is Bluetooth, handle accordingly
                else
                    /// Handle accordingly
            }
        }

        AudioManager.DeviceConnectionChanged += OnDeviceConnectionChanged;
        ```

    - To receive a notification whenever the device state changes:

        ``` {.prettyprint}
        void OnDeviceStateChanged(object sender, AudioDeviceStateChangedEventArgs args)
        {
            if (args.Device.Type == AudioDeviceType.BluetoothMedia)
            {
                if (args.Device.State == AudioDeviceState.Deactivated)
                    /// Bluetooth device has been deactivated, handle accordingly
                else
                    /// Handle accordingly
            }
            else
            {
                /// Handle accordingly
            }
        }

        AudioManager.DeviceStateChanged += OnDeviceStateChanged;
        ```

        **Note** The initial state of the connected device is
        `Deactivated`.
