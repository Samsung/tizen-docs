Visual Detection and Recognition
================================

## Dependencies

- Tizen 4.0 and Higher

You can perform various visual detection and recognition tasks in your
application. You can detect or generate barcodes. In addition, you can
track how faces or image objects move as well as detect and recognize
faces or objects.

You can use the following visual detection and recognition features in
your .NET applications:

-   [Barcode Detection and Generation](image-barcode-cs.md)

    You can handle images containing barcodes. You can encrypt a message
    by generating a barcode from it, and you can also detect barcodes in
    an image or from a camera preview stream.

- [Face Detection, Recognition, and Tracking](face-detection-cs.md)

    You can detect a face from an image, and recognize a face with a set
    of examples. You can also track a face within the camera
    preview stream.

- [Image Recognition and Tracking](image-recognition-cs.md)

    You can extract features of an image object and recognize it from
    specific images. You can also track the image object within the
    camera preview stream.
