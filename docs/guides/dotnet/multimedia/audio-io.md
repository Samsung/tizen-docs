Raw Audio Playback and Recording
================================

## Dependencies

- Tizen 4.0 and Higher

Pulse Code Modulated (PCM) data contains uncompressed audio. You can
play and record uncompressed audio data both synchronously and
asynchronously.

The main uncompressed audio management features are:

-   Playing uncompressed audio

    You can [play uncompressed audio](#play_pcm) in your application.

- Recording uncompressed audio

    You can [record uncompressed audio](#record_pcm) synchronously
    or asynchronously.


Audio Output <a id="play_pcm"></a>
------------

The
[Tizen.Multimedia.AudioPlayback](https://developer.tizen.org/dev-guide/csapi/classTizen_1_1Multimedia_1_1AudioPlayback.html)
class enables your application to play uncompressed audio. You can [play
audio synchronously](#simple_playback), or [do it
asynchronously](#async_playback).

Your application must define the following PCM data settings:

-   Audio channels:
    -   Mono (1 channel)
    -   Stereo (2 channels)
-   Audio sample type:
    -   Unsigned 8-bit PCM
    -   Signed 16-bit little endian PCM
-   Audio sample rate:
    -   8000 \~ 48000 Hz

To support various low-end Tizen devices, the application must follow
certain guidelines:

-   Do not use excessive instances of the
    `Tizen.Multimedia.AudioPlayback` class.

    Using many `Tizen.Multimedia.AudioPlayback` class instances
    decreases application performance, because processing audio data for
    re-sampling and mixing imposes a heavy burden on the system.

- Use the device-preferred PCM format.

    To reduce the processing overhead, select the PCM format based on
    the target device preference (for example, signed 16-bit little
    endian, stereo, 44100 Hz).

    Using the preferred format reduces internal operations, such as
    converting audio samples from mono to stereo or re-sampling audio
    frequency to fit the target device's input sample rate.

- Reduce event delay and remove glitches.

    The `Tizen.Multimedia.AudioPlayback` class instance works
    recursively, using events. The smaller the buffer size, the more
    often events are generated. If you use a small buffer in addition to
    other resources (for example, a timer or sensor), application
    performance decreases because the events cause delays. To prevent
    problems, set an appropriate write buffer size.

    To guarantee that the events of the `Tizen.Multimedia.AudioPlayback`
    class work independently, create a `Tizen.Multimedia.AudioPlayback`
    class instance in the event thread.

- Use double buffering.

    Use the double-buffering mechanism to reduce latency. It works by
    first writing the data twice before starting playback. After
    starting, whenever the event handler is called, you can write
    additional data.

- Save power.

    If audio playback has stopped for a long time, such as because the
    screen has switched off or there is no audio data, call the
    `Unprepare()` method of the `Tizen.Multimedia.AudioPlayback` class
    to pause the stream and save power. The device cannot go into the
    sleep mode while the `Tizen.Multimedia.AudioPlayback` instance is in
    the `Running` state.


Audio Input <a id="record_pcm"></a>
-----------

You can enable your application to record uncompressed audio from a
microphone-type input device. You can [record audio
synchronously](#simple_recording) with the
[Tizen.Multimedia.AudioCapture](https://developer.tizen.org/dev-guide/csapi/classTizen_1_1Multimedia_1_1AudioCapture.html)
class, or [do it asynchronously](#async_recording) with the
[Tizen.Multimedia.AsyncAudioCapture](https://developer.tizen.org/dev-guide/csapi/classTizen_1_1Multimedia_1_1AsyncAudioCapture.html)
class.

Audio data is captured periodically. To receive the audio PCM data from
the input device, you must implement the audio capture interface to
notify the application of audio data events, such as when the audio data
buffer is full.

Before recording audio, you must define the following PCM data settings:

-   Input device type:
    -   Microphone
-   Audio channels:
    -   Mono (1 channel)
    -   Stereo (2 channels)
-   Audio sample type:
    -   Unsigned 8-bit PCM
    -   Signed 16-bit little endian PCM
-   Audio sample rate:
    -   8000 \~ 48000 Hz


Prerequisites
-------------

To make your application visible in the Tizen Store only for devices
that support a microphone, the application must specify the following
feature in the `tizen-manifest.xml` file:

``` {.prettyprint}
<feature name="http://tizen.org/feature/microphone"/>
```


Managing Synchronous Playback <a id="simple_playback"></a>
-----------------------------

Because the synchronous playback process blocks other processes running
in the same thread, launching a playback process from the application
main thread can make the application unresponsive. To prevent this,
launch the playback process from its own thread.

To play audio:

1.  Prepare the audio output device and start the playback process using
    the `Prepare()` method of the
    [Tizen.Multimedia.AudioPlayback](https://developer.tizen.org/dev-guide/csapi/classTizen_1_1Multimedia_1_1AudioPlayback.html)
    class:

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    var audioPlayback = new AudioPlayback(44100, AudioChannel.Mono, AudioSampleType.S16Le);

    /// Prepare the audio output device (start the hardware playback process)
    audioPlayback.Prepare();
    ```

    The hardware device prepares its internal output buffer
    for playback. Playback begins when the internal output buffer starts
    receiving audio data.

2. To start playing the recorded audio, copy the audio data from the
    local buffer to the internal output buffer using the `Write()`
    method of the `Tizen.Multimedia.AudioCapture` class:

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    int bytesWritten = audioPlayback.Write(buffer);
    ```

    The returned value represents the number of bytes written to the
    internal output buffer.

3. Stop the playback process using the `Unprepare()` method of the
    `Tizen.Multimedia.AudioCapture` class:

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    audioPlayback.Unprepare();
    ```


Managing Asynchronous Playback <a id="async_playback"></a>
------------------------------

The asynchronous playback process uses the `BufferAvailable` event of
the
[Tizen.Multimedia.AudioPlayback](https://developer.tizen.org/dev-guide/csapi/classTizen_1_1Multimedia_1_1AudioPlayback.html)
class to play the recorded audio. The event is raised for each recorded
audio chunk. In the following example, the audio data is read from a
stream.

To start playing the recorded audio:

1.  Add an event handler for the `BufferAvailable` event:

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    audioPlayback.BufferAvailable += OnBufferAvailable;
    ```

2. Prepare the audio output device and start the playback process using
    the `Prepare()` method of the `Tizen.Multimedia.AudioCapture` class:

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    audioPlayback.Prepare();
    ```

    The hardware device prepares its internal output buffer
    for playback.

3. Play audio from a stream.

    Read audio data from the stream and write it to the internal output
    buffer using the `Write()` method of the
    `Tizen.Multimedia.AudioPlayback` class. Playback begins when the
    internal output buffer starts receiving the audio data.

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    Stream stream;

    void OnBufferAvailable(object sender, AudioPlaybackBufferAvailableEventArgs args)
    {
        if (args.Length > 0)
        {
            try
            {
                /// Allocate a local buffer for reading the audio data from the stream
                byte[] buffer = new byte[args.Length];

                /// Read audio data from the stream and store it in the local buffer
                stream.Read(buffer, 0, args.Length);

                /// Copy the audio data from the local buffer
                /// to the internal output buffer (starts playback)
                audioPlayback.Write(buffer);
            }
            catch(Exception e)
            {
                Tizen.Log.Error(LOG_TAG, "Failed to write. " + e);
            }
        }
    }
    ```

4. Stop the playback process using the `Unprepare()` method of the
    `Tizen.Multimedia.AudioCapture` class:

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    /// Stop the hardware playback process
    audioPlayback.Unprepare(output);
    ```

    The device no longer raises the event.


Managing Synchronous Recording <a id="simple_recording"></a>
------------------------------

Before starting the synchronous recording process, you need to know the
size of the buffer where the recorded audio data is to be saved, based
on the expected recording duration. The recording process ends once it
has read the specified number of bytes.

To calculate and set the required buffer size, use one of the following
options:

-   Calculate the buffer size based on the recommendation of the sound
    server, such as PulseAudio:

    1.  Retrieve the recommended buffer size using the `GetBufferSize()`
        method of the
        [Tizen.Multimedia.AudioCapture](https://developer.tizen.org/dev-guide/csapi/classTizen_1_1Multimedia_1_1AudioCapture.html)
        class:

        ``` {.prettyprint}
        var audioCapture = new AudioCapture(44100, AudioChannel.Mono, AudioSampleType.S16Le);

        int bufferSize = audioCapture.GetBufferSize();
        ```

        If no exception is thrown, the method returns the preferred size
        in bytes, based on the specified audio parameters.

        The recommended buffer size depends on the device. The size can
        be different for mobile, wearable, and TV devices.

    2. Set the buffer size to correspond to the desired
        recording duration.

        For the device in this example, the `GetBufferSize()` method
        returns the recommended buffer size for 100 milliseconds of
        recording time. To determine the total recommended buffer size,
        multiply the recommended buffer size by 10 (to get the buffer
        size per second) and by the length of the recording in seconds:

        ``` {.prettyprint}
        const int RecordingSec = 5;

        bufferSize *= 10 * RecordingSec;
        ```

- Calculate the required buffer size explicitly:

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    int bufferSize = AudioCapture.SampleRate * (audioCapture.Channel == AudioChannel.Stereo ? 2 : 1) *
        (audioCapture.SampleType == AudioSampleType.S16Le ? 2 : 1);

    bufferSize *= RecordingSec;
    ```

The synchronous recording process blocks other processes running in the
same thread. Launching a recording process from the application main
thread can make the application unresponsive. To prevent this, launch
the recording process from its own thread.

To record audio:

1.  Prepare the audio input device and start the recording process using
    the `Prepare()` method of the `Tizen.Multimedia.AudioCapture` class:

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    audioCapture.Prepare();
    ```

    The hardware device starts buffering the audio recorded by the audio
    input device. The audio data is buffered to the internal
    input buffer.

2. Read the audio data from the internal input buffer using the
    `Read()` method:

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    byte[] buffer = audioCapture.Read(bufferSize);
    ```

    The `Read()` method can behave in the following ways:

    -   If the method is called immediately after preparing the audio
        input device, it blocks the thread that it was launched from
        until it reads bytes specified.
    -   If the method is called with a delay long enough to allow the
        internal input buffer to store more audio data than the
        specified size, the method returns immediately without blocking
        its thread.

3. Stop the recording process using the `Unprepare()` method:

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    audioCapture.Unprepare();
    ```


Managing Asynchronous Recording <a id="async_recording"></a>
-------------------------------

The asynchronous recording process uses an event to store the audio
recorded by the audio input device. The event is raised for each
recorded audio chunk. In this use case, the audio data is stored in a
stream.

To start recording audio:

1.  Add an event handler for the `DataAvailable` event of the
    [Tizen.Multimedia.AsyncAudioCapture](https://developer.tizen.org/dev-guide/csapi/classTizen_1_1Multimedia_1_1AsyncAudioCapture.html)
    class:

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    var asyncAudioCapture = new AsyncAudioCapture(44100, AudioChannel.Mono, AudioSampleType.S16Le);

    /// Add an event handler invoked asynchronously for each recorded audio chunk
    asyncAudioCapture.DataAvailable += OnDataAvailable;
    ```

2. Prepare the audio input device and start the recording process using
    the `Prepare()` method of the `Tizen.Multimedia.AsyncAudioCapture`
    class:

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    asyncAudioCapture.Prepare();
    ```

    The hardware device starts buffering the audio recorded by the audio
    input device. The audio data is buffered to the internal
    input buffer. The event is raised for each audio data chunk.

3. To store the recorded audio data:

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    Stream stream;

    /// Event handler invoked for each recorded audio chunk
    void OnDataAvailable(object sender, AudioDataAvailableEventArgs args)
    {
        /// Write the recorded audio data to the stream
        stream.Write(args.Data, 0, args.Data.Length);
    }
    ```

4. Stop the recording process using the `Unprepare()` method:

    ``` {.prettyprint}
    asyncAudioCapture.Unprepare();
    ```

    The device no longer raises the event.
