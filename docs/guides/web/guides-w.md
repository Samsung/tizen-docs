​	**Note**	In Tizen Web Device APIs, there are 2 types of APIs: mandatory and optional.The mandatory APIs are always available on all Tizen devices. The optional APIs provide functionality that depends on the available device hardware or software capabilities, and they may not be available on all Tizen devices. For example, the Bluetooth and NFC API hardware features are optional, and not supported on all devices.To determine the availability of optional APIs, use the `tizen.systeminfo.getCapability()` method of the System Information API (in [mobile](../../../../org.tizen.web.apireference/html/device_api/mobile/tizen/systeminfo.html#SystemInfo), [wearable](../../../../org.tizen.web.apireference/html/device_api/wearable/tizen/systeminfo.html#SystemInfo), and [TV](../../../../org.tizen.web.apireference/html/device_api/tv/tizen/systeminfo.html#SystemInfo) applications).Note that all mandatory APIs are supported on the Tizen Emulators, while the optional APIs may or may not be supported. For more information on support for each API, see [Tizen Web Device API Reference](../../../../org.tizen.web.apireference/html/device_api/device_api_cover.html).
