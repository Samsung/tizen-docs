The data storage and management features introduce how you can manage the data stored on the device. They describe the file systems and how you can access and handle the data.

You can use the following data storage and management features in your Web applications:

- [Data Filtering and Sorting](./data/data-filter-w.md)

  When managing large amounts of data, you can create filters to search for specific information, and make queries to receive only the information you are looking for. You can use various filter attributes and sort the received data.

- [File System](./data/file-system-w.md)

  You can manage the files and directories in the device file system. The accessible parts of the file system are represented as virtual root locations, which form a collection of locations that function as a single virtual device file system.

- [Stored Content Management](./data/stored-content-w.md)

  You can locally search and manage multimedia content, such as images, videos, or music. You can also perform content management tasks, such as viewing and updating content attributes.

- [File Archiving](./data/file-archiving-w.md)

  You can manage ZIP archives on the device. You can create and browse the archives, and extract files from the archive.
