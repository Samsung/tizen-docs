# W3C/HTML5/Supplementary Features

## Dependencies

- Tizen 2.4 and Higher for Mobile
- Tizen 2.3.1 and Higher for Wearable 

The W3C, HTML5, and supplementary features introduce various functionalities you can use in your application. You can use graphics, media, storage, and location features, as well as manage communication and security. These features also enable you to create an application UI using the Tizen Advanced UI (TAU) framework or HTML and CSS.

The following W3C, HTML5, and supplementary features apply in **mobile and wearable applications only**:

- [Device](./w3c/device/device-guide-w.md)	

  You can manage information about device-specific features, such as vibration and browser state. You can also manage the battery status, and detect touch and rotation events.
- [Graphics](./w3c/graphics/graphics-guide-w.md)

  You can use the HTML5 canvas and SVG support to create graphic elements in your application. You can create and edit various kinds of images, shapes, text, and elements.

- [Media](./w3c/media/media-guide-w.md)

  You can play and capture audio and video, and create a multimedia stream for real-time recording. You can also control the playback process by retrieving information about the playback duration and media content downloading progress, and checking the supported media formats.

- [Communication](./w3c/communication/comm_guide_w.htm)

  You can use various communication features, such as bi-directional network connectivity, XML HTTP requests, and Web Messaging. You can also connect to a socket server to send and receive data.

- [Storage](./w3c/storage/storage-guide-w.md)

  You can store and manage data in, for example, files, application caches, and SQL databases. You can also access and manage sandboxed media storages.

- [Security](./w3c/security/security-guide-w.md)

  You can control HTML element and client-side cross-origin requests. You can share resources safely across different domains and block HTML elements.

- [Performance and Optimization](./w3c/perf_opt/performance-guide-w.md)

  You can use Web workers to run scripts in the background. To manage application performance further, you can control the animation rate and page visibility.

- [Location](./w3c/location/location-guide-w.md)

  You can determine the geographical position of the device using various positioning methods, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) and network positioning system. You can retrieve the user position only once, or continue to receive updates to see how the position changes.

- [Useful Guides for W3C/HTML5 Features](./w3c/useful/useful-guide-w.md)

  You can use common W3C features to play sounds to provide responsiveness on user interaction, and to improve the performance of wearable Web applications.

- [Supplementary Features](./w3c/supplement/supplement-guide-w.md)

  You can take advantage of supplementary features in creating Tizen Web applications. You can access binary data in JavaScript with typed arrays, create 3D visual elements with the WebGLâ„¢ graphics library, display elements on full screen views, and control the device camera.

- [User Interface](./w3c/ui/ui-guide-w.md)

  You can create a visual outlook for the UI application to ensure the best possible user experience. The Tizen platform provides the W3C/HTML5 UI toolkit framework for developing a Web application.
