# Terms of Service

By using the Tizen.org website you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions here.

Here’s the basic idea:

- Don't violate anyone's intellectual property and post anyone else's copyrighted or confidential material you don't have permission to use.
- Don't post anything vulgar, inflammatory, pornographic, illegal, etc.
- Don't post spam.
- Too many metalinks and tags are not accepted. If you try to boost your SEO, that's an abuse of the system.
- Don't post just to sell something. Sure, talk up your project, but don't mention how to buy it every single time.
- Don't launch into personal attacks. You're not going to agree with everyone, but name-calling will just cause trouble and will be regarded as flaming behavior.
- Tone down the foul language. You can say what you need to say without relying on cursing. In fact, your writing will be regarded as that much more creative.

Tizen.org is providing a framework for discussion and user generated information to expand the knowledge base of Linux-related information. Please note that articles, as well as any other user content on the Yocto Project (such as blogs, directory content, forums, comments, etc.), do not reflect the views or endorsements of the Linux Foundation, its staff, or its members. We recognize there may be inaccurate information reflected in this site and that users should understand that something that appears on Tizen.org does not mean the Linux Foundation has vetted or endorsed that content.

Linux Foundation reserves the right to take down anything you post on this site, for these or other reasons. If you don't agree to these terms, don't use this website. Violation of the terms in this document may result in the removal of the content and a warning from the site's administrators. A second violation will result in the removal of your user account.
