# Typographic Conventions

------

Typographic conventions used in this documentation set are as follows:

- [Optional_Argument]

  The square brackets, [], indicate an optional argument.

- <Variable>

  The angle brackets, <>, indicate a variable. Replace <Variable> with an actual value.

- x|y|z

  The vertical bar, |, indicates that only one of the options can be selected.

- \

  The backslash, , indicates that the new line followed is a continuance of a long statement.

  For example, the two versions of commands are equivalent.

  With backslash:

  ```
  $ tar –zxvf \repo.tar.gz
  ```

  Without backslash:

  ```
  $ tar –zxvf repo.tar.gz
  ```
