Tizen developers use the git and [gbs command-line tools](https://source.tizen.org/documentation/reference/git-build-system) for most of their work.
Tizen source code is managed by [Gerrit](https://source.tizen.org/documentation/reference/gerrit-usage), a code review system for Git-based projects. Source code cloning, development, and review are under ACL (Access Control Lists). Make sure you get rights to access them.
